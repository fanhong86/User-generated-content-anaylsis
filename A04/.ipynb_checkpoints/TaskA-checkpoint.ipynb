Revered by both Jews and Muslims, the site is believed to be the oldest continuously used intact prayer structure in the world, containing the burial sites of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish People. The Arabic name of the complex reflects the prominence given to Abraham, revered by Muslims as a Quranic prophet and a patriarch through Ishmael. After the 1994 massacre of 29 Palestinian worshippers inside the mosque by Baruch Goldstein, an American-Israeli physician and religious extremist, Israeli authorities divided the mosque complex between Jewish and Muslim worshippers. Hebron is home to roughly 150,000 Palestinian Muslims and 700 Jewish settlers, the latter living in a series of Jewish-only enclaves guarded by Israeli troops.</td>\n",

In 2005, the population consisted of 423 to 502 individuals, after having crashed in the 1940s to just 40 animals. By 2015, there were 540 of the tigers here. Anti-poaching efforts have been integral to the rise in tiger numbers, with tougher punishments for the illegal trafficking of endangered animals and their parts. Interestingly, and worryingly, a broad genetic sampling of 95 wild Russian tigers found markedly low genetic diversity. This lack of diversity is becoming an increasing problem across a multitude of species as populations crash, and are then brought back from the brink of extinction. A lack of genetic diversity increases the odds that a species will be vulnerable to disease, among other things. #notrade  #noextinction - To see more of my work and projects follow me here @chancellordavid</td>\n",

The family didn’t move by choice, but by necessity. About a month ago they were having a barbecue in the back yard of their old house when a shell exploded in the garden. It was the final sign that the neighbourhood was too unsafe to stay in any longer. So they moved, but not far, only a few kilometers away. The place where they live now is a bit better, but not significantly safer. It’s always hard for an outsider to understand why people, especially young middle-class people, keep living in war zones. The simple exercise in this case is to imagine that you have to leave your home tomorrow, forever, with only one suitcase or what you can fit in the car, and to try to answer all the questions that would arise. Would your parents agree to go too, or will you have to leave them behind? What about grandparents? What are you going to do with your pets? It has been more than four years since the war in Ukraine began. The front line is static and life around it is pretty normal—or so it seems. People in conflict zones get used to danger. Like everywhere else, they work, cook, have fun, fall in love, get married and raise children. Text by Alisa Sopova @sopova.alisa, a Ukrainian journalist from Donetsk. #5kfromthefrontline</td>\n",

I've been using camera traps to connect people with the #PathOfThePanther , and this week I get to bring @univmiami students there for a #NatGeoUnivMiami  workshop on there as part of a two-day science and storytelling event, #NatGeoOnCampus , which gives college-age students the opportunity to tackle the local and global issues facing our planet in collaboration with National Geographic Explorers. Check the link in my bio for a list of inspiring speakers, and check out @insidenatgeo this Friday and Saturday for a behind-the-scenes look at the event, including my panel on the future of Florida. #FloridaWild  #KeepFLWild</td>\n",

Around dusk the sounds of shelling and gunfire begin. People may appear relaxed, but it’s an illusion: they listen to determine the degree of danger. Usually they don’t react as long as they hear that the shelling is outgoing. When they hear incoming, they start listening carefully. Signs of closer hits, such as a particularly loud sound, a tangible explosion wave, or car alarms triggered by it, usually serve as signals to go inside. Everyone knows the safest place in their home. It has been more than four years since the war in Ukraine began, and nothing spectacular is happening anymore. The frontline is static, and life around it is pretty normal—or so it seems. People in conflict zones get used to danger. Like everywhere else, they work, cook, have fun, fall in love, get married, and raise children. Text by Alisa Sopova @sopova.alisa, a Ukrainian journalist from Donetsk. #5kfromthefrontline</td>\n",

During the site’s excavation, major archaeological remains from the Joseon dynasty were uncovered, including original sections of the Seoul City Wall, which have been incorporated into the park.

She was a girl of 16 wrapped in exquisitely woven textiles frozen into the 21,000-foot summit ridge of Mountt Ampato. The weaving tradition was strong in this part of the Andes for centuries, but by the time I arrived it had languished. With a grant from National Geographic, the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco has helped revive, preserve, and pass on the Andean weaving tradition. The women of this cooperative still dye yarn in the traditional way. Their work is wonderful. Today they make a replica of the Ice Maiden's wrappings. Seeing a copy of her wrappings brought back a flood of memories from that first assignment. Of course I’m bringing a set home. #Peru</td>\n",

In the end, they chose the center—generally considered a more pleasant venue, despite being next to a minefield. After signing their marriage certificate, the bride and groom bowed to their parents. “Now that you are married to each other, don’t forget to call your parents,” said the registrar who married them, “and come to visit them.” That simple advice to the newlyweds, the kind that most newlyweds elsewhere may receive, was also a reminder that in these front-line areas of a war that has simmered for years, many young people leave for safer places while their parents stay behind. It has been more than four years since the war in Ukraine began. The front line is static and life around it is pretty normal—or so it seems. People in conflict zones get used to danger.

       "      <td>Photo by @stevewinterphoto | On October 29th, the government of China revealed that it will allow commercial trade in tiger bone and rhino horn from farmed animals for use in traditional Chinese medicine research and clinical treatments. Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.” China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them). This will further the trade in wild tigers, as the “wild tiger” will now be more valuable than farmed. @natgeo @stevewinterphoto @wildaid @eia_news</td>\n",

Nocturnal behavior, startling screams, and mythology regarding some lemur species as holding the spirits of ancestors are thought to contribute to their ghostly name connection. The aye-aye is at the center of countless myths on the island of Madagascar, with many locals holding the belief that an encounter with the aye-aye brings great misfortune. Some Malagasy even believe that the aye-ayes are man-eaters, which is why you should never leave your village in the dark. In reality, the aye-aye leads a solitary life and is nocturnal, meaning an encounter with this unique lemur is rare. With increased education and ecotourism to Madagascar, there is hope that this species will be viewed as a treasure and not as a threat. Photographed @denverzoo. #ayeaye</td>\n",

It's not uncommon to see elephants shaking each tree to check whether the fruit has ripened and will fall.

       "      <td>Photo by @stevewinterphoto | On October 29th, the government of China revealed that it will allow commercial trade in tiger bone and rhino horn from farmed animals for use in traditional Chinese medicine research and clinical treatments. Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.” China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them). This will further the trade in wild tigers, as the “wild tiger” will now be more valuable than farmed. @natgeo @stevewinterphoto @wildaid @eia_news</td>\n",

In this photo @harry__turner is holding the remains of an 8-foot red tail boa constrictor we found on the edge of a forest that had been in flames just days before. Smoke was rising from the earth and the ground was still hot to the touch. There was no color, just black and grey. The scene suggested the snake had slithered as fast as possible to make it to the river, but that the burns to over half its body overwhelmed it, and the beautiful creature died just a few feet from safety. The sadness amongst us was such that one could feel it in the air. The hardest part wasn’t that they died but how they died. In one hour of searching a football field-sized clearing, @harry__turner, @melissalesh, and I found 4 dead snakes, 4 dead yellow footed tortoises, dozens of lizards and rodents, and hundreds of insects. The loss of rainforest alone gives all of us, including me, good reason to think more carefully about the sources of the things we buy. But knowing so many animals meet their end like this has renewed my vigilance to be a more careful consumer. Head on over to @tbfrost to see a happier photograph of this same species of boa alive and well, living in a national park. #snakes  #snakesofinstagram  #rainforest  #peru  #snek  #fires  #deforestation  #reptiles</td>\n",

This is seen in a number of mammals and most cats (including house cats), and allows them to check the reproductive or territorial status of others. Both males and females will bare their teeth like this when they come across a scent that gives them a chemical signal. This dominant male is testing the pheromones in the urine of a female who is coming into estrus and, after sensing her readiness, will track her very closely.

Our animal family is so much like us: They find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel, and have emotions, we will all be better humans. We need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not. Jaguars are the third largest of the big cats. They are found from the U.S./Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in Brazil's Patanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguar's range. Poaching for skins, bones, and teeth is also growing for the first time since the 1970s to feed the demand of people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth,” Chinese traditional medicine, and now luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid My first story with big cats was the first @natgeo jaguar story 20 years ago! It has changed my life working with the magical and magnificent cats of the world. Animals have emotions just like we have.

Having spent the last few days with my head in a bucket, the sight of South Georgia Island’s massive cliff faces and stunning glaciers was as much a relief as it was spectacular! Partnered with epic scenery, this island is home to one of the highest concentrations of wildlife on the planet. Given this and its remoteness, you would be forgiven for thinking it has always been an untouched wilderness. Unfortunately this is not the case. We humans hunted the whales and seals to near extinction and introduced an army of egg eating rats that ran riot through the ground nesting bird colonies. Whilst South Georgia is a document of the worse of human nature, it is also a document of the best. Thanks to protection and hard work from a special group of people, the island’s wildlife has made a remarkable recovery. // Check out the new season of Wild_Life at natgeo.com/wildlife.</td>\n",

You are looking at a perfectly preserved Kiva, or underground ceremony room, in #BearsEarsNationalMonument , Utah, with storytelling by @marlon.magdalena from Jemez Pueblo. While this looks like a video, the world you move through is actually a virtual model that takes you into the various rooms of the 800-1000 year old Ancestral Pueblo site. This model (and many others) will be shared with Pueblo communities across the South West. We're especially hoping to share it with school children and elders who might not be capable of making the journey to their ancestral homelands. To learn more about how to experience the full interactive version of this and other sites follow @argonautphoto. My partner in this project was @devlin_gandy and we were able to make this experience thanks to funding from @InsideNatGeo, National Geographic magazine, and @NatGeoMuseum and the final 360 video with the help of @max.salomon!

       "      <td>Photo by @amivitale | It is devastating to hear that China has decided to reverse its 25-year-old ban on the sale and use of rhinoceros and tiger products. The reversal allows for these products to be used in medical research or healing, uses long since proven to have no benefits to humans. This change will certainly lead to more pressure on already terribly vulnerable animal populations and place in greater danger the conservationists, rangers and communities who fight for the survival of these majestic creatures. Here, Sudan, the last living male Northern White Rhino left on this planet is comforted moments before he passed away March 19, 2018 in northern Kenya. Sudan was brought to Kenya from @safari_park_dvur_kralove in the #Czechrepublic  in 2009. He died surrounded by people who loved him at @olpejeta and has been an inspirational figure for many across the world. If there is any meaning in his death, its that Sudan can be our final wake up call. In a world of 7 billion, we need to start recognizing that we are not separate from nature. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then saving nature is really about saving ourselves. Today, fewer 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild. We are witnessing extinction on our watch and must help them by speaking out and supporting conservation efforts worldwide, especially among the indigenous communities who are on the front lines every day against poaching.

It will allow the use of powdered rhino horns and tiger bones for “medical research or in healing” from farmed rhinos and tigers in government certified Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) hospitals - In a statement announcing the replacement of the 25-year old ban, the State Council said powdered forms of rhino horn and bones from dead tigers could be used in \"qualified hospitals by qualified doctors”. The animal products can only be obtained from farms, it said, and added ‘“parts from those animals classified as ‘antiques' could be used in cultural exchanges if approved by the cultural authorities. Even if restricted to antiques and use in hospitals, this trade will surely increase confusion by consumers and law enforcers as to which products are, and are not legal, and would likely expand the markets for other tiger and rhino products. This comes on the very same day that WWF’s Living Planet Report reveals that “humanity has wiped out 60% of wildlife since the 1970s” and that the “Earth is losing biodiversity at a rate seen only during mass extinctions.” Follow me here @chancellordavid @natgeo @thephotosociety @everydayextinction to this more on this story and other work and projects.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Photo by @maggiesteber | “If you long for a mind at rest and a heart that cannot harden…go find a gate that opens wide into a secret garden.” - Author Unknown. A variety of leaves, seeds, bugs, bird eggs and even the chest bone from a chicken collected from the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma, a personal project that I began a couple of years ago to deal with a buildup of having witnessed a mixture of both the worst and the best of humankind. Many photographers have personal projects and it is these in which instead of telling the stories of others, we tell our own stories in whatever form we please. This is what the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma is for me. In my career I have covered everything from war to fashion and seen great suffering and violence. I have told stories about heroic figures and those who were beaten down by life. We photographers choose to be in places where we see suffering and glory and to bear witness. But these things impact us in unexpected ways including a kind of longing for normality or loneliness or missing home or feeling completely disconnected from the world. We don’t realize the toll it takes on us until we are forced to face it. In the past two years alongside regular assignments, sometimes challenging ones, I decided I needed to play, to plant the seeds of new ideas, to be wild at heart without having to make excuses or explain myself, to tell my own story or a part of it. I created The Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma. Lily is my alter ego in an alternate universe. She is everything I am not….or maybe she is everything I am. It doesn’t matter, it is a release from this world and a visit into my wild imagination. #secretgarden  #lilylapalma  #imagination  #innerpeace  #myownstory</td>\n",

Some have been killed by rival packs, some killed by human hunters and one was taken stolen by a rival pack. One of the most amazing aspects of Mr. Blue’s character is that he has this ability to mingle his way into existing wolf packs. He must have that perfect personality mix of non-threatening, submissive behavior and perhaps it's his age shows in the color of his fur. Knowledge is power in both humans and in wolves, so perhaps Mr. Blue’s epic life experiences make make his acceptance into other packs possible.

       "      <td>Photo by @stevewinterphoto | @Zakouma_National_Park in Chad, @africanparksnetwork, is one of the most amazing ecosystems on the planet – the amazing abundance of life found here is off the charts. Zakouma is just one of 15 parks managed by conservation NGO African Parks (@africanparksnetwork). If you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to Zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. Tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods. What is happening in Zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. The park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory – and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016. Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

       "      <td>Photo by @CarltonWard | Did you know that the first modern cattle and horses in the United States landed on the Gulf coast of Florida in 1521? Ponce de Leon brought them on sailing ships from Spain during his second voyage to the New World. Although he was attacked by Calusa Indians (and later died of his wounds in Havana), cattle and horses remained. When my ancestors migrated into Florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the Florida woods for nearly three centuries. Descendants of these original Spanish livestock are called \"\"cracker\"\" cattle and horses today. Early American settlers of the Florida frontier were also called \"\"crackers\"\", attributed to the \"\"crack\"\" of their cow whips. Modern horses actually evolved in North America but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. Much of the southeastern US was adapted to grazers. There were herds of wild bison in Florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). There are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the Northern Everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems. Cattle grazing in this region has been shown by @ArchboldStation to increase net carbon sequestration by grasslands. Ranches here also provide important wildlife habitat for bears, panthers and other native species while protecting land from development in the #FloridaWildlifeCorridor .

Gina found time to read the classic Three Men in a Boat, which seemed quite appropriate for this expedition. In rough seas, however, things were very different. Trying to find a stable position to go to sleep without being thrown around was very difficult. In these situations Gina would move to the floor where she could pen herself in so that she wasn’t sliding around. Either way, from here on she would be sleeping on dry land. #EAGRE18  @greenland_caves</td>\n",

       "      <td>Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Too close for comfort! @Zakouma_National_Park in Chad, @africanparksnetwork, is one of the most amazing ecosystems on the planet – the amazing abundance of life found here is off the charts. Zakouma is just one of 15 parks managed by conservation NGO African Parks (@africanparksnetwork). If you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to Zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. Tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods. What is happening in Zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. The park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory – and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016. Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

This month marks the 100th anniversary of the closing of Carlisle, which was the first government off-reservation Indian boarding school in the United States — it would become the model for future boarding schools throughout the U.S. and Canada. Roughly 12,000 Native children attended, many of whom were taken from their families and communities by force in the name of coercive assimilation. This cemetery near where the school once stood is home to the graves of 184 students. Mr. Sam has spent the past 30 years working to help identify and repatriate the remains of children who died while at boarding schools across the country. He came to Carlisle in early October for a gathering hosted by the Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which brought together Native boarding school survivors, activists, and many community leaders who, like Mr. Sam, are working to bring the children buried at Carlisle back to their homelands. #carlisle  #indianboardingschool  @nabshc</td>\n",

Dr. Dan Stahler, and (soon to be Dr.) Colby Anton @cobblestonetosandweasel have led a group of dedicated scientists and technicians with the goal of learning more about the cougars of @yellowstonenps northern range. I helped iron out the kinks in their camera trapping operation in the beginning with the help of an @insidenatgeo grant, and now we just can’t quit talking about how much fun we had, as well as how these animals continue to amaze us.

Known as \"la Città Sotterranea\" (the Subterranean City), the city is centred on the \"Sassi di Matera\" (meaning \"The Stones of Matera\"). The Sassi originate from a prehistoric troglodyte settlement, and are suspected to be some of the first human settlements in Italy, Indeed, Matera is the only place in the world where people can boast to be still living in the same houses of their ancestors of 9,000 years ago. Miserably poor throughout the centuries, and a burden on the national psyche, the Sassi were forcibly cleared in the 1950s, but in recent years have seen the return of tourists, boutique hotels and Hollywood film crews. Matera is a candidate for European Capital of Culture for 2019.

I was, I’ll admit, pretty lost. What at first was a slightly nervous moment as this warrior simply came and sat next to me, has over the years developed into a deep respect both for the man and his work with @ewasolions in the Samburu, northern Kenya. The African lion population has declined by 43% in the last 20 years and lions now occupy only 8% of their historical range in Africa. The estimated numbers of lions across Africa are approximately 20,000. In Kenya, the national population now numbers less than 2,000 individuals. At current rates of decline, the species could become extinct here within the next two decades. This reduction in lion numbers is primarily due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, typically when lions kill people’s livestock. Lions and other large carnivores are wide-ranging species, and designated protected areas are often not large enough to ensure their long-term survival. It is crucial, therefore, that conservation of these species, as well as their prey, is addressed throughout the landscape, which not only incorporates protected areas, but also the surrounding areas where local people live. @ewasolions is dedicated to conserving lions and other large carnivores by promoting co-existence between people and wildlife, they work hand-in-hand with local communities to provide education, training and improved conservation practices that help people and wildlife, using sound science to help guide the long-term conservation of lions across community conservancies and protected areas in northern Kenya, and I love their work 👍🏿👍🏼💚to see more of it, follow me here @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @natgeo @everydayextinction @ewasolions #conserving  #conservation  #carnevores  #northernkenya  #kenya</td>\n",

       "      <td>Photo by @chien_chi_chang | I have been working in New York’s Chinatown since 1992—for more than 26 years—and it is still a project in progress. Immigration is often propelled by suffering. To witness the shifting patterns of populations is to see the world in all its exigencies—war, natural disasters, repression, famine, poverty and persecution. But there is a rainbow at the bottom of that Pandora’s box of troubles; hope, too, propels immigrants to settle in strange lands. I should know: I am one myself. I have followed and photographed twenty families in Chinatown, and those relationships are now culminating in a tri-generational drama. The people in these pictures were all willing to sacrifice their immediate comfort to realize the dream of giving their children a \"better\" life. Some of that first wave of immigrants have now returned to China to enjoy the rest of their lives in prosperity, with family members they have not seen for decades. Others are trying to live the American dream. The common thread, the universal quality in this work, is the essential human need to hold hope in your hands. #MagnumPhotos  #cccontheroad</td>\n",

From way up high, I fantasize about how I would know exactly where I was if I found myself in the valleys thousands of feet below. The reality of course is that I have no idea what lies beneath me in the beautiful and brutal landscape of the Alaska Range, or for that matter the majority of Alaska's approximate 50 million square miles of wilderness. // T.

The picture of hunters seen in their blaze orange garments, shotguns held aloft, just beyond the pickup truck in the foreground with a pheasant rooster lying still alongside a bale of straw, was not published in the essay I did called \"Hunters,\" published in the November, 2007 issue of National Geographic. Both the magazine designer and I wanted this to be the lead picture but it lost out to another image of mine featuring hunters in a vast central Montana field rehabbed by the conservation group @pheasants_forever. The beauty of the pheasant is apparent in even in death although the brilliance of its coloration I believe lessens in death. When I was assigned to do the photography for this essay I really thought it would be popular with readers. I feared the recoil by those who might find killing a deer, such a graceful and docile animal, very distasteful if displayed in the magazine. I could not have been more wrong. The story \"Hunters\" received more mail than any other story published that year and response by readers was six to one positive. I believe the reason was very much influenced by the information given in the article about how hunting is part of the overall effort of conservation and managing wildlife in our country; from license fees wildlife refuges are helped to benefit bird watchers and those who simply enjoy the many areas set aside for wildlife habitat. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of \"Hunters\" and other assignments spanning a five-decade career. @thephotosociety #hunter  #pheasants  #southdakota  #pheasanthunting  #birdhunting  #blazeorange  #onassingment</td>\n",

If we can find a way to believe they think, feel and have emotions we will all be better humans. We need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not. Jaguars are the 3rd largest of the big cats. Found from US / Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in this area where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range. Also poaching for skins, bones and teeth is growing for the first time since the 1970’s to feed the demand for people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth”, Chinese Traditional Medicine and now Luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid My first story with big cats was the 1st @natgeo Jaguar story 20 years ago!

These beautiful and elusive whales can be recognized by their unicorn-like tusk, which is used as a tool to hunt their primary prey: polar cod. Narwhals rely heavily on the presence of sea ice as the polar cod life cycle is completely tied to the ice. It’s heartbreaking to realize the spiral of consequences associated with the impacts of climate change, especially as it relates to one of our oceans most majestic marine animals. From the Arctic to the Antarctic, the planet's polar regions are under threat from climate change.

I was given a wonderful sculpture of a bull elephant. When my partner in life and work @ChristineEckstrom examined it closely, she realized it had been modeled after a photo I had made on assignment for @natgeo years ago of a famous elephant named \"Survivor\" in Zambia’s North Luangwa Valley. Survivor lived through a previous poaching holocaust in the 1980s and he was written up in Mark and Delia Owens' books \"Eye of the Elephant\" and \"Survivor’s Song.\" The bull elephants depicted here, which I photographed in Botswana one memorable evening, lived more tranquil lives thanks to its government’s enlightened policy of putting a moratorium on elephant hunting, but even there the tide is turning. Nearly one hundred elephants were found poached in an area recently that had been a safe haven for years. I’m sharing this image in honor of all elephant champions including the late Paul Allen, and respectfully ask that you consider supporting the organizations that can turn the current poaching crisis around and secure a future for elephants.

With this giant wingspan of more than 11ft, these birds are able to glide effortlessly over the waves for 1000s of miles in search of food. Scientists put heart rate monitors on albatross to gauge their energy expenditure during different activities. The study found that if the wind direction was favorable for the direction the bird wanted to travel, their heart rate was not much higher than when they’re sat on the water resting. This shows that their 11ft wingspan combined with ultra efficient flying techniques allow flight with very little extra energy cost. Nice one nature. We were lucky enough to encounter this beautiful bird during our 6 day crossing to the Island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. // Check out the new season of Wild_Life at natgeo.com/wildlife.</td>\n",

She has never stopped fighting for justice and answers about the disappearance of her son. She is not alone. An estimated 20,000 people are still missing. // Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. Women are hardly passive victims though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. // This work was made with the support of the International Committee of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organization working on all sides of conflict to alleviate people’s suffering.

       "      <td>Photo by @CarltonWard | I grew up on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It’s where I first fell in love with the water and became a conservationist. Stories from my parents made me realize how much the health of the estuaries and fisheries had degraded in just one generation. For the past dozen years I’ve been focused a bit further inland, working to raise visibility of the Florida Wildlife Corridor — a 17-million acre network of connected wildlife habitat that is very much threatened from expanding roads and development. The Corridor is hidden in plain sight for most of Florida’s 21 million residents and 120 million annual visitors, and same could be said for the Gulf. I am thankful to have experienced the intersection of these two worlds during the 2015 #Glades2Gulf  Expedition (supported by @insidenatgeo). This photo was made on Day 10 of that journey among tendrils of the Chassahowitzska River delta. I couldn’t find my team members to use as subjects during the first of the magical sunrise, so I set my camera on a tripod, started the interval timer and paddled off into the fog. The experience was one of my favorites from the 70-day trek. Later that year, this image was selected as the cover for The Forgotten Coast, made for PBS by @GrizzlyCreekFilms. In many ways, the Gulf of Mexico is America’s Forgotten Coast. Last week the specific region of the Florida panhandle officially known as the Forgotten Coast was devastated by Hurricane Michael. My prayers are with the people, many whom lost their homes. Let us remember and support them. You can donate to the Red Cross hurricane relief through the link in my bio. #ForgottenCoast  #GulfofMexico  #Resilience  @Sea_Legacy @ilcp_photographers @mallorydimmitt @joeguthrie8 @natgeoimagecollection #FloridaWild  #KeepFLWild  @FL_WildCorridor</td>\n",

Like all Okavango lions, her muscles are highly developed from running through water on a daily basis and she is bigger than most lions found in other areas. It is not possible to live in this wet environment without learning to incorporate the water into following prey species and being successful in hunting them. She currently has small cubs tucked away from the rest of the pride and is hunting on her own. @dereckjoubert and I have watched her stalking red lechwe in the deep swamps for hours. She doesn't stop until she is successful. With the very high numbers of lechwe around the island, she also doesn't need to hunt at night and indeed seems to be getting up later and later in the day - often hunting around mid-day. We used to stay with these lions from pre-dawn to film their hunts, but we're learning that right now, when the sun is rising, we too can rest with her. She's not going to move if she doesn't need to. #thisismytrophy  #okavangolions  #bigcats  #dubaplains</td>\n",

       "      <td>Photo by @chamiltonjames words by @chrisfagan_uac | Jorge is chief of the Chitonahua tribe, one of several indigenous tribes in Peru considered in initial contact with the outside world. His eye was shot out by a logger when Jorge and his dad tried to raid a logging camp for machetes and other items in the mid 1990’s. They escaped, but soon after were hunted down by the loggers aided by guides from another indigenous tribe. Approximately 15 Chitonahua were captured and forced to leave the forest interior and relocate to a village on the Yurua River where they live today. Despite being contacted over 20 years ago, the Chitonahua still struggle to assimilate into modern society. This includes earning money to purchase salt, medicine, clothing and other items they now depend on. However, compared to many other tribes in initial contact in Peru, the Chitonahua are doing relatively well. They have an impressive garden of vegetables, fruit trees and medicinal plants and recently won a government sponsored competition among local villages for raising domesticated animals. Perhaps most importantly, the children attend school nearby and speak fluent Spanish. Shot for the Peru part of our October issue on the Amazon’s isolated tribes. Check out the link in @chrisfagan_uac profile for more information on tribes in initial contact like the Chitonahua.</td>\n",

He has never been able to afford his own flock, and is constantly on the move—a reason, he says, that women have always left him. In Transylvania and other remote areas of Romania, many people farm on a small scale, in ways unchanged for centuries. Their farms have among the lowest yields in Europe, but also some of the highest levels of self-sufficiency. Lack of money and suspicion of unfamiliar methods mean that few chemicals and artificial fertilizers are used. But in the past decade, many have abandoned their farms for at least part of the year to work in cities abroad. Romania’s 2007 entry into the European Union also threatened this traditional way of life, as farmers cannot compete with European imports, and the small size of farms means they are not eligible for EU subsidies.

To make the 600-mile journey from Agadez, an ancient Nigerien caravan city that has grown into Africa’s most notorious human-smuggling hub, across the Sahara to Libya was to risk death at the hands of bandits, terrorists, and the elements. Then in 2015 the journey became even more perilous. “The army started hunting us,” says Adji, who at 32 had been ferrying migrants to Libya for nearly 15 years. “They are even shooting at our trucks.” I photographed the EU-funded crackdown on Niger’s smuggling industry as part of a special investigation led by @tymccormick5 and published in @foreignpolicymag last year. This series ‘My Smuggler, My Savior’ explores the complicated role these men play in the lives of those attempting the journey to Europe. They’re migrants’ only chance of making it safely across the Sahara. They’re also outlaws engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Niger’s military. Adji’s truck was hijacked by bandits in 2016 as he traveled along a new and more dangerous route to Libya. He barely survived, walking for miles in the desert before stumbling across another migrant caravan. For the sake of his wife and children, Adji says he has left the trade, but those who are still willing to make the trip can expect profits even bigger than before. #migration  #europe  #niger</td>\n",

As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as \"\"the most alien-looking place on Earth”. In the Dragon's Blood tree Forest at Diksam. An hour long exposure. The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an \"\"upturned, densely packed crown\"\". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as \"\"dragon's blood\"\". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock. One of the species' greatest threats is the gradual dessication of the archipelago.

But in 2015, @AfricanParksNetwork assumed management of the park on behalf of the Government, and immediately got to work training and outfitting their Ranger unit, preventing poaching, removing almost 30,000 snares, and making the park safe for nature's return. In 2017 they reintroduced cheetahs, and just as of August 16th, they reintroduced lions to restore this iconic species to the park, and help balance natural systems by bringing back critically needed predators. This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

A few weeks after this photo was taken, Alex made history by making the first free solo of El Capitan - climbed it without ropes. Heralded by some as one of the greatest athletic feats of all time. The stakes could be no higher…perfection or death. Directed by @mochinyc and @jimmy_chin, the film was shot over two years while following Alex during his meticulous preparation and final climb. Much more than a climbing film, Free Solo is about life, love, dreaming big and facing your fears. @FreeSoloFilm has opened in theaters to rave reviews and leads the nominations for the third annual Critics' Choice Documentary Awards. The film expands nationwide this weekend. For more information about cities, theaters and tickets head to www.freesolofilm.com. Shot on assignment for @natgeo.

This border area between Peru and Brazil is home to perhaps the largest number of people living in isolation on earth. But despite its remoteness their lives are being threatened. A different tribe recently contacted nearby, told of a horrific massacre by men with automatic weapons; most likely narcos who use the area to move coca to Brazil. This photo was taken at a safe distance and only after we were certain nobody was at home. The tribe who live in the village are semi-nomadic and known to leave for weeks at a time to collect turtle eggs and other resources closer to major rivers. Shot for the Peru part of our October issue on the Amazon’s isolated tribes. Check out the link in @chrisfagan_uac profile for more information on isolated tribes in the area.</td>\n",

Elephants are lucky enough to have a very varied diet and spend the winter months eating more bark and woody vegetation. After a long winter, the reduced levels of nutrients can begin to take a toll on their condition - particularly in younger animals. The elephants will soon feast on green grass when the rains come, but right now they’re actively digging for rhizomes and bulbs to supplement their woody meals.

I was given a wonderful sculpture of a bull elephant. When my partner in life and work @ChristineEckstrom examined it closely, she realized it had been modeled after a photo I had made on assignment for @natgeo years ago of a famous elephant named \"\"Survivor\"\" in Zambia’s North Luangwa Valley. Survivor lived through a previous poaching holocaust in the 1980s and he was written up in Mark and Delia Owens' books \"\"Eye of the Elephant\"\" and \"\"Survivor’s Song.\"\" The bull elephants depicted here, which I photographed in Botswana one memorable evening, lived more tranquil lives thanks to its government’s enlightened policy of putting a moratorium on elephant hunting, but even there the tide is turning. Nearly one hundred elephants were found poached in an area recently that had been a safe haven for years. I’m sharing this image in honor of all elephant champions including the late Paul Allen, and respectfully ask that you consider supporting the organizations that can turn the current poaching crisis around and secure a future for elephants.

She works in a specialist gunshot and bomb blast wounded ward set up and run by the ICRC in the State Specialist Hospital in Maiduguri. Everyday she stitches wounds and plugs gaping wounds of men and women who’ve experienced first hand the destructive force of sharp exploding metal. // Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. While living with and reacting to those consequences, women are hardly passive victims, though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. // This work was supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organization working on all sides of conflict to alleviate people’s suffering.

The main population is housed at Cikananga Conservation Breeding Center (CCBC) @cikananga.foundation in Java where a captive breeding program was implemented in 2013. Over the past 5 years the facility has bred a total of 18 birds, with 17 still residing at CCBC. The key to success for this species will come from getting birds from different captive populations to breed with one another. The more genetic diversity a population has, the healthier it is, and the greater its chance of survival. With a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck this species may one day return to the wild. @zootrhy_plzen where this bird was photographed houses and breeds and has one of the finest collections of this species in the world.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Photo by @williamalbertallard | India, 2002. I got to work in India for the first time in what was kind of the twilight of my career that dates back to 1964. I was assigned by @natgeo to photograph the Dalits, also known as the Untouchables, those people who exist on the lowest rung of the India caste system. This man has just emerged from cleaning out a sewer filled with filth by using only a bucket and a rope. After finishing and closing the concrete cover, he had to go to several nearby homes before gaining permission to wash himself off with a garden hose. Because he is an Untouchable he is destined to do what his father, his grandfather, and all the men in his family's past did, to clean waste from sewers. There are Untouchables generations destined to a tradition of washing clothes, or tanning leather hides, or other tasks members of the upper castes refuse to do. Despite his situation, this man who sits covered in sewage, wears a thin gold chain around his neck and I was struck by how it seemed to match the glint of pride in his eyes as I made his portrait. He may be a collector of other people's wastes, but he does so with self esteem. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of India and other @natgeo assignments spanning five-decades. @thephotosociety #india  #Dalit  #castes  #onassignment  #untouchable \"</td>\n",

A couple of friends and I are the only ones in our group who still don’t have kids of our own. I naturally began to observe how the others were raising their children. I watch them playing together, hear the arguments and the kids’ complaints at mealtimes or at bedtime. I’ve often been the one in charge of the kids when those moments happen. Just maybe, all of these things are making me start to want to be a father. That is why I’ve decided to make the relationships between fathers and their children the focus of this photo project. Wherever I am in the world, when I meet a father I ask him to tell me about a special moment he has spent with his children and, when I can, I photograph them together /// From the about FATHERS - Breda, The Netherlands – Raoul (43), Tijn (6) and Ole (4) - Raoul is from Portugal originally, but he has been living in Holland for many years. He’s a successful entrepreneur and owns a consulting company that operates in the oil and gas sector. He lives in Breda with his wife and children. He commutes to Rotterdam for work every day, by train or by car. “It’s a little stressful, but I’d rather live in a small city than in Rotterdam.” He travels to the Middle East, too, about 5 or 6 times a year. Raoul doesn’t have much free time to be with his family. He’s mostly only able to spend time with them on weekends, which he loves spending with his children. Lately, their favorite pastime has been bicycling. “Ole, the youngest, is just now learning to ride by himself, so I still have to help him all the time and be careful that he doesn't fall.” /// Follow me for more stories @gabrielegalimbertiphoto #father  #fathers  #dad  #dads  #netherlands  #bike  #biking  #breda  #rotterdam  #holland  #fatherhood</td>\n",

Socotra (Arabic: سُقُطْرَى Suquṭra), is an archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea and territorially part of Yemen. The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 240km (150mi) east of the Horn of Africa. It has been described as \"\"the most alien-looking place on Earth”. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life isn't found anywhere else on Earth. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 endemic species; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more.

The cave of Altamira was reported in 1880 by Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. It was the first paleolithic art cave to be identified. The cave was first greeted with amazement but the discovery soon deteriorated into deep controversy that followed Marcelino Sanz de Salutoula to his grave. In the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. Paintings like this could not have possibly been made by Ice Age people. It was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in France that Altamira was accepted as genuine. Archaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the Upper Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 BCE). Uranium/Thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the Aurignacian and Solutrean periods (36,000-22,000 BCE). This U-T dating suggests that Altamira was painted over a period of more than 10,000 years. To see more follow me, @salvarezphoto and my nonprofit @ancientartarchive.</td>\n",

We had to be quick, first not to drift, but also because I simply like it: the pressure does not crush me, it embraces me. But how could one believe that this planet is only 3 minutes from ours.

The dragon’s blood tree is a strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree that is only found in Socotra. Its red sap was the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a medicine and a dye. Socotra is a small island in the Indian Ocean that is part of Yemen. It is far from the main land (about 350 Km) and that has contributed to its historic and biological isolation over the years resulting in an amazing endemic fauna and flora. Surveys have revealed that more than a third of the 800 or so plant species of Socotra are found nowhere else. It has been till recently a Yemeni military base, were access was very restricted, and this has contributed to preserve it from any kind of mass tourism. But the immense beauty of the mountainous landscape, the stunning variety of the underwater life, the pristine beaches and uniqueness of its flora are making it a sought-after ecotourism destination. #socotra  #tree  #yemen</td>\n",

       "      <td>Photo by @CarltonWard | The corner of the northern Gulf of Mexico where Hurricane Michael made landfall is known as the Forgotten Coast. My prayers are with the people, many of whom lost their homes and businesses to tornado strength winds and tremendous storm surge. I’m thinking about towns like Apalachicola, where 80 percent of households depend upon Gulf fisheries for their livelihoods, and remembering my time there during the last Florida Wildlife Corridor Expedition. In this photo, third generation Apalachicola Kendall oysterman Schoelles tongs for oysters in St Vincent Sound where one million acres of contiguous protected land extend north from the coast, providing crucial wildlife habitat while helping ensure the health of the estuary downstream. Oysters filter the bay to clean the water. In that way, Kendall and oyster men and women like him are protecting the Gulf for all of us, especially as they plant new oyster beds that also help buffer the coast against storms. I trust Kendall has weathered this hurricane. He and his family have weathered storms on the Gulf for more than a century. Hopefully he will be tonging for oysters and caring for the bay again soon. Maybe there will be a silver lining and the hurricane will have dissipated the red tide that has been plaguing the Gulf this summer, arguably exacerbated by pollution from millions of coastal residence who don't live in balance with the ecosystem the way Kendall does. But the Gulf is resilient and balance and sustainability are possible if we all pay attention and do our part. Long live the Forgotten Coast. #GulfofMexico  #ForgottenCoast  #FloridaWild  @FL_WildCorridor @Nature_org #KeepFLWild  @SeaLegacy #TurntheTide  @natgeoimagecollection</td>\n",

Many people envision working in the studio as a high-energy, creative experience with me shouting “beautiful baby, beautiful” and the dogs responding with pose after pose like models before the lens of the famous fashion photographer and international spy, Austin Powers. The reality is, I’m somewhat unable to speak when making photographs. It’s a genetic flaw or some right brain/left brain quirk realized when I was rejected from my childhood garage band for not being able to sing and play drums at the same time. Damn you Phil Collins. When we work, this leaves me with a limited menu of grunting noises and the occasional guttural outburst, which I still find helpful in getting an animals attention. It also passes for a kind of barbaric shorthand between my wife Callie and I, until she tires of it and gets mad at me, which she finds helpful in getting my attention. Zorro is a 12 year-old Standard Poodle, too smart to get in the middle of our bickering. He tried to stay neutral but always sided with Callie. This is often the case with the nice lady holding food and I learn to live with rejection. This is more frustrating because Zorro is a very special dog that lights up a room when he enters and I want a dog like that to like me. More caregiver than therapy dog, Zorro has always been there for the people who needed him most, some at the end of their lives and some who would miss those people the most. Our connection was fleeting and dramatic and came together when I was finally able to vocalize a sound that engaged Zorro. I was trying to say his name but it came out with a poor rationing of consonants to vowels; Shtwa -thwo-or-oht-za-moAlshs This stopped Zorro, deeply engaged with Callie and a snack of some kind, He turned to me, tilted his head and then he gave me -The Eyes; the eyes that had comforted, the eyes that had gotten him out of trouble, the eyes that had earned him more than his fair share of mac and cheese. And then, Zorro burped. Beautiful baby, beautiful. You can find more dispatches from #TheYearOfTheDogs , a personal project by @vincentjmusi</td>\n",

This gently portrait of an Amish boy holding his pet guinea pig started my career as a professional photographer and my 50 years as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine. In the spring of 1964, I was blessed with getting a photographic internship at National Geographic in Washington D.C. after showing my portfolio of work to Robert E. Gilka, the legendary director of photography at National Geographic. As my first assignment as an intern, Gilka sent me to Lancaster County, PA to cover a Pennsylvania Dutch festival. \"\"Try to get some pictures of the Amish, if you can,\"\" he told me. It seemed the magazine had a finished manuscript about the Amish but had no pictures. He didn't tell he'd earlier sent a staff photographer to Pennsylvania who'd come back with nothing. Although I photographed the festival events my success with the Amish came through driving the country roads, introducing myself to Amish farmers, many of whom turned me down but eventually finding one who allowed me to photograph his family and their way of life. My first assignment which was to have been for a weekend or perhaps a week, lasted through much of the summer and into the fall of 1964. On an overcast afternoon, after photographing an Amish farmer working in his fields I was brought to the barn by his son so he could show me his pet guinea pig. My portrait of the boy and his pet became the lead picture in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster county published in the August, 1965 issue, a story which has been credited as the beginning of a new, more intimate look at people in the National Geographic Magazine. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of the Amish and other assignments spanning a five-decade career. @thephotosociety #amish  #farm  #onassignment  #filmphotography</td>\n",

The portrait of the fragile but seemingly unafraid little girl seen alongside the heads of two enormous draft horses was published in the August, 1964 issue of National Geographic in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The child was with her father who was working in his fields. At some point in the afternoon she was standing in the back of a farm wagon, the horses, unhitched, were about to be led to the barn and for a moment they provided the background for her profile. Her blouse appears worn, perhaps a bit dirty from childish play, and its pale blue color seems to echo the softness in the child's light complexion and wispy, blond hair. Photographing the Amish was the beginning of my photographic depiction of several subcultures in my country and elsewhere during the 1960's. My essays on the Amish in 1964, the Basques of France and Spain in 1968, and the Hutterites of Montana in 1969, all dealt with the lives of people living in a culture of their own. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of the Amish and other assignments spanning five-decades. @thephotosociety #amish  #farm  #child  #horses  #onassignment  #filmphotography</td>\n",

       "      <td>Photo by @maggiesteber | This is Philomene, a young girl I photographed in the dry northwest town of Beauchamp, Haiti many years ago. I’m posting her photograph to remember her and other young Haitian girls today on the International #DayoftheGirl . She was a student in a small local school. She told me she loved to read and that one day she hoped to be a nurse. I never saw her again after that visit but I think of her quite often because she so embodied the spirit and talent and the hopes and sense of possibility that all Haitians share and that is shared by young girls around the world. I hope she accomplished her dreams. Like many developing nations, the literacy rate in Haiti is low and below the average for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Haiti faces shortages in educational supplies and qualified teachers where the rural population is less educated than the urban. A major earthquake in 2010 exacerbated an already difficult system by destroying infrastructure and displacing 50 to 90% of of students. Private education, which must be paid for, has substituted for education in public schools although the government has attempted initiatives to change this. I tried very hard to help educate children in Haiti but the need was like a bottomless pit. In the world young women 15-29 are more than 3 times as likely as young men to not be in employment, education or training, according to UNICEF. Education can help change stereotypes we have held onto too long and take advantage of the talent and creative voices of girls to make a more vibrant and equitable world. There are many organisations, ranging from public to private, that support and promote the education of girls around the world. If you want to make the world a better place and safer for young women, please consider researching and supporting the education of girls and give them a voice. #dayofthegirl  #tooyoungtowed  #unicef  #educategirls  #haiti  #education</td>\n",

Da Silva is nearsighted, which means it is difficult for her to read or see anything at a distance. Currently more than a billion people worldwide need glasses, but have no way to get them. Taking their commitment to bring sight to the world, OneSight, an independent nonprofit, hosted their first-ever, fully digital, eye clinic in the Amazon. More than 2,000 patients traveled to the clinic during a five-day boat expedition to bring better vision to a remote and underserved area. Lack of access to good vision care is no small issue. It can create a cascading series of problems for individuals, families, and communities - starting in school, when students can’t see what’s going on and have trouble reading. Uncorrected vision can have an impact on a persons employment prospects and even lead to social isolation. // Over a billion people across the world need glasses, but have no way to get them.

It was an almost ten year dream and years of meticulous preparation that made Alex’s Free Solo of El Cap possible....and yes, an absurd amount of focus, determination and the capacity to manage fear like no other helped too. Shot on assignment for @natgeo during the filming of #FreeSolo . • Free Solo expands into another 100 theaters across the country this weekend in cities including Seattle, San Francisco, Portland, Atlanta, Austin, Saint Louis and many others. 100% on Rotten Tomatoes!

       "1    Video by @amivitale | Wild adult elephants drink and cool off at a watering on the Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy. An elephant’s trunk typically holds around half of a gallon of water, but a big bull elephant can hold as much as 2.5 gallons. After spraying themselves, the elephants will often coat themselves with dust which acts as a bug repellent and sunblock. Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy is home to Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e), the first ever community-owned and run elephant sanctuary in Africa. Reteti operates in partnership with Conservation International (@conservationorg) who provide critical operational support and work to scale the Reteti community-centered model to create lasting impacts worldwide.

       "3    Photo by @irablockphoto | A nighttime view from the top of the Old Town Bridge Tower of the Charles Bridge and Prague Castle along the banks of the Vltava River in Prague, Czech Republic. The Charles Bridge was constructed under King Charles IV of Bohemia starting in 1357 and was finished in the begging of the 15th century. The bridge is a very popular tourist destination especially at sunset and early evening when the city lights up. Prague Castle dates back to the ninth century and is still in use today - as the office of the president of the Czech Republic. It is rumored to be the largest ancient castle in the world, occupying 750,00 square feet (70,000 square meters) and housing St Vitus Cathedral. #followme  @irablockphoto to see more images from the world. - - - #praguecastle  #vltavariver  #prague  #czechrepublic  #charlesbridge  #kingcharlesIV  #praguecatle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "5    Photo by @PaulNicklen | It’s difficult to express what it is like to be in the company of an orca. I watch as it glides effortlessly through the blue ocean waters, and I feel totally at peace with this animal. But in this moment, there’s not only one orca, there are many. A family on the hunt. Orcas have become one of the most demonized marine animals, and I am always trying to steer people away from this impression by capturing the beauty and intelligence of these complex cetaceans. Right now, I am back in Norway to shine a light on the importance of this keystone species and its associated ecosystem. #FollowMe  at @PaulNicklen for photos from this expedition. #Norway  #orcas  #nature  #ocean                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "6    Photo by @TimLaman | This is the third highest peak on the world’s second biggest island? Know where this is? The island is New Guinea, a rugged, mountainous, rain forest covered island, second biggest in the world after Greenland and the biggest tropical island, and split between the countries of Papua New Guinea in the east, and the western half which is part of Indonesia, including the provinces of Papua and West Papua. The peak is Peak Trikora, 4730 meters (15,580 ft) tall, and only a little less than Carstenz Pyramid, the highest peak on the island at 4884 meters (16023 ft), both of which are in the Indonesian half of the island. Most people have no idea there are such big mountains on New Guinea so close to the equator… the range of habitats created from the tropical lowlands to the alpine zone contributes to the incredible biodiversity of New Guinea. #NewGuinea  #Papua .

       "7    Photo by @michaelchristopherbrown | Thousands of Jews visited the Cave of the Patriarchs, known to Muslims as the Ibrahimi Mosque, in the West Bank city of Hebron on September 25, during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. Revered by both Jews and Muslims, the site is believed to be the oldest continuously used intact prayer structure in the world, containing the burial sites of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish People. The Arabic name of the complex reflects the prominence given to Abraham, revered by Muslims as a Quranic prophet and a patriarch through Ishmael. After the 1994 massacre of 29 Palestinian worshippers inside the mosque by Baruch Goldstein, an American-Israeli physician and religious extremist, Israeli authorities divided the mosque complex between Jewish and Muslim worshippers. Hebron is home to roughly 150,000 Palestinian Muslims and 700 Jewish settlers, the latter living in a series of Jewish-only enclaves guarded by Israeli troops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

In eight hours on an average Tuesday, my camera captured 263 helicopter flights and some 40 boat rides on the southwest boundary of Grand Canyon National Park. This wave of industrial tourism creates financial stability for the neighboring tribal community but raises questions of safety, noise, and park protection.

       "9    Photo by @simoncroberts | Visitors to the Ttukseom Hangang Park, an urban green space in Seoul, sit in the shade of a motorway overpass. Hangang, also known as the Han River, is the main body of water that runs through the middle of the capital city of South Korea. As in many cities, urban planners in Seoul have realized the significance of parks and green spaces to help combat issues of air pollution, improve public health, and to meet demands for increased leisure time.

       "10   Photo by Charlie Hamilton James @chamiltonjames | A lone male elephant reaches for fresh leaves in the branches in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique, last week. We all know about the threats facing elephants and their decline in many parks across Africa. But in Gorongosa, elephant numbers are recovering. Years of civil war wiped out much of the park's wildlife, and poaching persisted until recently. However, increased security and investment into the park and the people who live in and around it have brought life back and now the park is thriving again. The story of Gorongosa will be featured in @natgeo magazine next year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "11   Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | 5 a.m. on the first morning on Wegener Halvø peninsula as sea fog rolls in over Nathorst Fjord. We continued our watches on land in 2.5-hour shifts, mostly observing musk oxex, though looking out for bigger furry white creatures too. It was a great opportunity for me to take photographs, though my partners were less enthusiastic at being awake in the middle of the night.

       "13   Photo by @BrianSkerry | A young harbor seal peeks at me over a mound of surf grass at Cortes Banks, a range of underwater mountains located 100 miles off the coast of San Diego, CA. This location, well known for stormy weather and giant waves, is a hotspot of biodiversity with an abundance of marine life found here. Places like this are oases of life in the sea, where each animal plays a role. Yet such places could easily be destroyed by a single fishing trawl net being dragged through it or by undersea drilling, and few would ever know it existed. Naturalist John Muir once said, \"\"When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.” Throughout my career of exploring our planet and especially the oceans, I have found this to be true: Everything is connected and every creature matters.

       "14   Wild_Life with @bertiegregory | Once factories of death, the abandoned whaling stations on the Island of South Georgia are now packed full of life. Fur seals, elephant seals and penguins, once hunted, now live amongst the ruins. This island is living proof that with protection and a lot of hard work, it is possible for wild places to come back from the brink. One part of South Georgia’s resurrection is still missing though; watch this week’s episode of Wild_Life to find out more. // Check out the new season of Wild_Life at natgeo.com/wildlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "15   Photo by @TimLaman | A Buffy Fish Owl triggers my camera trap on a natural treefall over a river in Borneo’s Gunung Palung National Park. I currently have a set of camera traps operating in a remote part of this spectacular lowland rain forest for my latest @NatGeo Society project. Why? Gunung Palung has one of the best remaining lowland rain forests in all of Borneo, and I want to tell the story of the richness of the biodiversity there, especially the species few people get to see. I’m going out to Indonesia every few months, but in between, my team members from @saveGPorangutans and #TamanNasionalGunungPalung  are monitoring my cameras and sending exciting reports from time to time about what we are getting. If you are curious about all of the equipment I use to get these shots, please take a look @TimLaman where I have shared a series of behind-the-scenes shots. #cameratrap  #owl  #Indonesia  #GunungPalung  #Borneo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "17   Photo by @PaulNicklen | Every single dive is a different experience, and I am driven by the adrenaline that comes with exploring the mystery of our oceans. My encounter with this male orca in Norway was a highlight of my career. He swam within mere inches of me and kept disappearing into the dark water before racing toward me and faking me out again and again. He playfully reacted when I jerked my head back during one of his passes. I live for these kinds of interactions. To experience the personality and charisma of an apex predator on their terms. My team and I are back in Norway to continue where we left off in 2016, photographing these beautiful creatures. It is a privilege to share the water with them, and I hope to return with images and stories that will inspire and give justice to this species and their ecosystem. #FollowMe  at @PaulNicklen for more photos of orcas and to follow along with this exciting expedition. #Norway  #orca  #ocean  #underwaterphotography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Walking around the iceless scene here was equally as shocking to me as I looked around at the evidence humans had left behind. The big melt, it’s happening.

       "23   Photo by @renan_ozturk | Figures on a landscape. One of the things I love about climbing is the community and inclusiveness within it. This is where it all started for me, and I was taken in by the tribe, and the place I come back to in order to check in and grow. This past trip was all about giving that back to others with new experiences like new desert crack climbers. In the spirit of our lost friends Micah, Dean, Bean, Stanley, Johnny, Hayden, we rage on, burning every moment of each day with wonder and gratitude.

       "24   Follow Aaron Huey @argonautphoto on assignment in the slot canyons of #EscalanteNationalMonument  in Utah today. On his feed he will be showing sites that were recently removed or otherwise affected when the monument was shrunk by nearly 50 percent and split into three smaller units by executive order. The Zebra slots here (carved over thousands of years by water in red and white striped sandstone) were not removed, but the trail to get to them, and the larger buffer area around them, were removed. This opens the area for potential resource extraction in the future. Photo credit: Drew Ludwig Follow @argonautphoto in the coming days for other views and videos from these slots! (Note on access and climbing: The slot canyons of Escalante involve a great deal of climbing to get in and out, no surfaces were marked or damaged in this image or on this assignment, and climbing is not just allowed in all these slots, it's necessary to get out!)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "26   Photo by @simoncroberts | The \"\"green\"\" exterior of a store on Myeongdong street in Seoul, South Korea, decorated with more than 50,000 pots of plants. Myeongdong is Seoul's main shopping district, popular with young people and tourists. After the Korean War, the country's economy expanded rapidly, and so did the population of Seoul. Many department stores, shops, restaurants, and shopping centers set up businesses in the Myeongdong area to keep up with this increasing demand. It is now estimated that the floating population of the district is up to two million people a day, and in terms of floorspace rents, Myeongdong is one of the most expensive shopping areas in the world.

The bedrock here is composed of soft white chalk that has been sculpted by strong winds into strange and beautiful shapes. So excited to be back in Egypt to do some paragliding.

       "28   Photo by @ismailferdous | Tamina and Alex organize a house warming party on Reformation holiday in their new garden house in Kleingartenverein Schießstand e.v. in Hamburg. Their neighbor Bernd appears in the party with his Halloween costume. October 31 is the Reformation Day observed as a public holiday in seven states in Germany. It commemorates when German monk and theologian Martin Luther’s proposals were nailed on the doors of a church in 1517. This event was the start of religious and social changes in Europe. On this holiday, adults and children in Germany celebrate Halloween and Reformation Day at the same time. #ReformationDay  #halloween  #Germany  #gardenhouse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

As the sun set over the Red Sea I watched as workers scrambled to construct this $590 million project, which is now complete. In Djibouti’s capital, China’s base is just a few kilometers from Camp Lemmonier, America’s largest military outpost in Africa. Flanked by Yemen, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia, Djibouti is viewed as a haven in the unstable Horn of Africa and hosts armed forces from around the world. #military  #base  #djibouti  #china  #nicholesobecki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "31   Photo by Lynn Johnson @ljohnphoto // #sponsored  by @bayerofficial // These are the women of Pink Steel. Every woman in this boat is a survivor of breast cancer. They are all ages—from mid 20’s to mid 70’s. Younger women may contribute more physical power but elders hold the center with will, encouragement and guts. Aging in this group is a testament to survival. They never give up in the boat as they didn’t give up on their very lives and so are models for all who paddle. The women gather often to practice for competitions—testimony to the healing energy of community. If one person hesitates, the cry goes up, “just get in the boat.” The boat is their rescue craft, the river in all its unpredictable patterns and currents, the challenge. Knowing the women in this boat was a privilege.

       "32   Photo by Joel Sartore @joelsartore // #sponsored  by @bayerofficial // My grandmother’s name was Faynell Meese. She grew up on a ranch near Darrouzett, Texas, proud and sure, a survivor of the Dust Bowl and the Depression and a thousand other insults over her 91-years, all of which thickened her hide. She told great stories, feared nobody, and drank Jack and Coke whenever she felt like it. She had two favorite sayings: “Marry in haste, repent at leisure”, and “When poverty walks in the door, love flies out the window.” As a child, I thought I’d meet more people like her.

Heidi ran a 5,000-acre ranch in Utah and was a respected, cattle boss, wrangler, chief cook and bottle washer, mother and public servant. At 77, Heidi is \"semi-retired,\" but works from a saddle and still connected to the land. Her son Matt runs ranch operations with The Nature Conservancy. Scientific research and environmental endeavors enhanced by Heidi’s years on the land help give insight to the past while studies on flora and fauna look to the future. // The challenges of the future are being worked on right now.

       "34   Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | Amur tiger, Russia’s Far East - 95 percent of the global population is here. In 2005, the population consisted of 423 to 502 individuals, after having crashed in the 1940s to just 40 animals. By 2015, there were 540 of the tigers here. Anti-poaching efforts have been integral to the rise in tiger numbers, with tougher punishments for the illegal trafficking of endangered animals and their parts. Interestingly, and worryingly, a broad genetic sampling of 95 wild Russian tigers found markedly low genetic diversity. This lack of diversity is becoming an increasing problem across a multitude of species as populations crash, and are then brought back from the brink of extinction. A lack of genetic diversity increases the odds that a species will be vulnerable to disease, among other things. #notrade  #noextinction - To see more of my work and projects follow me here @chancellordavid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "35   Photo by Stephen Alvarez @salvarezphoto | The Moai of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) are some of the most iconic statues in the world. The heaviest erected statue weighs an astonishing 86 tons. Nine hundred of the statues were erected between 1250 and 1500 one an island that is barely 15 miles long. There are no other inhabited islands for nearly 2,000 miles in any direction. Sometime around 900 A.D., the founders of Rapa Nui set out from their home islands in Polynesia in open-decked sailing canoes. They not only found this incredibly remote land, but then, guided only by the stars and their knowledge of the ocean, they returned to their homeland, packed up all that they would need to begin a new existence on Rapa Nui, and set out to find the island once again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Its intricate beauty has always captivated my attention. #jerusalem  #sebil  #waterfountain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "39   Photo by @stephsinclairpix | Portrait of @diandraforrest in the park with her son. Diandra has the rare genetic condition of albinism and has built a successful modeling career from her unique looks. However, many people with albinism are still severely discriminated against, and in some countries even attacked, because of their appearance. In the U.S., approximately one in 18,000 to 20,000 people have some type of albinism. In other parts of the world, the occurrence can be as high as one in 3,000. Most children with albinism are born to parents who have typical hair and eye color for their ethnic backgrounds.

       "40   Photo by @tbfrost | It almost seems this little snake is saying, “Hey there! How’s it going?” Of course, it actually meant something closer to, \"\"Please leave me alone.” Many snakes are not aggressive as some people claim, but they are defensive. And, no, snakes don’t chase people. Not even cottonmouths. See video in my bio link @tbfrost's for proof. Anyway, I remain grateful this beautiful black-skinned parrot snake stopped long enough for a picture as I continue my two-year-long project on snakes. Want to see to see more snake portraits?

       "41   Photo by @gerdludwig | With handheld lamps at dusk, an aboriginal artist and two of her friends collect tiny seashells for traditional aboriginal necklaces on Cape Barren Island, off the northeast coast of Tasmania, Australia. No full-blooded Tasmanian Aborigines have survived mainly as a result of the brutal annihilation campaigns in the 19th century. Today, an estimated 20,000 people in Tasmania have Aboriginal lineage, many of them living on the Fourneaux Islands (Flinders and Cape Barren). @natgeocreative @thephotosociety #CapeBarren  #Tasmania  #Australia  #aboriginal  #seashells  #dusk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "43   Photo by @peteressick | Cuyahoga River, Cleveland, Ohio. The modern environmental movement in the USA was born here when the Cuyahoga River set on fire on June 22, 1969. The reaction from a TIME magazine article about the event resulted in the first Earth Day a year later, and the Clean Water Act followed in 1972. Like many rivers in the Great Lakes region, the water quality of the Cuyahoga is much improved but the sediments, vegetation and aquatic life are still impaired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "45   Photo by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | Sandy Johnson and his son Preston ride into the sunrise as they begin a long day of moving cattle for a branding just East of Dark Canyon inside what was briefly #BearsEarsNationalMonument , Utah. Spending several days with Sandy and his family helped me to better understand the perspective of local communities who fear monument status brings new restrictions on their way of life and added traffic from tourists. The family has been living inside of the one-time monument for decades, running cattle on hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands. This past summer through the drought they had to spend much of their time moving tens of thousands of gallons of water from a series of storage ponds, using an old pump truck, to move it to smaller water tanks deeper in. The \"Battle for the American West\" is our current cover story and looks at how the fight over public lands is taking shape in Utah, Nevada, Oregon, and beyond.

       "46   Photo by Anastasia Taylor-Lind @anastasiatl | Anna Kirichenko just moved into a new house in Toretsk, eastern Ukraine, together with her husband, Andrey, and 3-year-old daughter, Ksyusha. The family didn’t move by choice, but by necessity. About a month ago they were having a barbecue in the back yard of their old house when a shell exploded in the garden. It was the final sign that the neighbourhood was too unsafe to stay in any longer. So they moved, but not far, only a few kilometers away. The place where they live now is a bit better, but not significantly safer. It’s always hard for an outsider to understand why people, especially young middle-class people, keep living in war zones. The simple exercise in this case is to imagine that you have to leave your home tomorrow, forever, with only one suitcase or what you can fit in the car, and to try to answer all the questions that would arise. Would your parents agree to go too, or will you have to leave them behind? What about grandparents? What are you going to do with your pets? It has been more than four years since the war in Ukraine began. The front line is static and life around it is pretty normal—or so it seems. People in conflict zones get used to danger. Like everywhere else, they work, cook, have fun, fall in love, get married and raise children.

I've been using camera traps to connect people with the #PathOfThePanther , and this week I get to bring @univmiami students there for a #NatGeoUnivMiami  workshop on there as part of a two-day science and storytelling event, #NatGeoOnCampus , which gives college-age students the opportunity to tackle the local and global issues facing our planet in collaboration with National Geographic Explorers.

Four million acres of contiguous protected land in South Florida provide key habitat for wide-ranging species, including bears and panthers.

Around dusk the sounds of shelling and gunfire begin. People may appear relaxed, but it’s an illusion: they listen to determine the degree of danger. Usually they don’t react as long as they hear that the shelling is outgoing. When they hear incoming, they start listening carefully. Signs of closer hits, such as a particularly loud sound, a tangible explosion wave, or car alarms triggered by it, usually serve as signals to go inside. Everyone knows the safest place in their home. It has been more than four years since the war in Ukraine began, and nothing spectacular is happening anymore.

       "51   Video by @renan_ozturk | This is the 4,000-foot-thick Ruth Glacier. With walls larger than Yosemite's El Capitan, it is truly one of the great wonders of Earth. In the decade I have been doing expeditions here, the glacial retreat is clear and present. The camp you see pictured here is normally pretty snowy, but in recent years it’s been rainy and hard to maintain life above the fern line. #climatechangeisreal  #turningthetide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

This non-profit research and breeding facility for giant pandas and other rare animals is located in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. The base was established in 1987 with six giant pandas, rescued from the wild, and has since overseen hundreds of panda births. There are now over 170 giant pandas at the facility, where tens of thousands of bamboo and other plants have been cultivated to provide the animals' diet and habitat.

       "53   Photo by @joelsartore | This is Amy, a 16-year-old buff-cheeked gibbon that lives @wrs.ig. Amy and her partner Fred form a bonded pair that will mate for life. Pairs of gibbons perform daily duets—their loud, ascending hoots provide a wild and haunting symphony that punctuates early mornings at the zoo. In Vietnam, agricultural development and logging are key threats to the gibbon, while in Laos, they are hunted mainly for food. Thankfully, @wrs.ig protects Amy and also works to take care of her cousins—the Javan gibbon—through the shade coffee and primate project in Central Java. The #SingaporeZoo  helps support the livelihood of the local community members who farm in a gibbon-friendly manner by buying shade-grown coffee and making it available to Zoo guests.

       "54   Photo by @TimLaman | Photobombed by a hornbill! There I was, up in the top of a tree trying to photograph the courtship display of a Red Bird-of-Paradise, when this Blythe’s Hornbill decided to land right in the middle of the bird-of-paradise action. At first the courting birds were a bit shy, and moved down below, but after the hornbill sat there for a few minutes, they realized he wasn’t a threat and moved back up to their favorite branches for display. In all my years photographing birds-of-paradise, this is one of the funniest things I’ve seen. What do you think this hornbill was thinking?

The life of a refugee is never easy after you leave your country…but it is even harder when you are indigenous and have to leave your land.

       "56   Photo by @chien_chi_chang | 2002. New York's Chinatown. Humans need to hold hope in their hands. This man was willing to live in poverty in hope of prosperity, to sacrifice his immediate happiness to realize the dream of giving his children a better life. It has been 16 years since I took this photo in New York’s Chinatown as part of an ongoing project about immigrants. A few years later, this man is now living with his family in New York, and today they are living the American dream. But is economic prosperity worth the social cost? Perhaps the answers to such questions can be found in the lives of the people left behind in China and in those of the second and third generations who are growing up in the United States. Look at them and listen to their voices. You may not understand their language, but you can feel their longing. #MagnumPhotos  #cccontheroad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "58   Film by @amivitale | An elephant is so much more than the sum of its parts. Elephants are very social animals and highly sensitive. Elephants can recognize themselves and have brain structures similar to humans. After a death, elephants show signs of grief and may return year after year to visit the bones of the deceased, touching them with their trunks. In addition to all of this, they also play a vital role in the ecosystem, clearing brush and trees and allowing grasses to flourish, which in turn helps bulk grazers thrive, and above them, apex predators.

       "59   Photo by @simoncroberts | The Dongdaemun Design Park (DDP) in Seoul, South Korea, was created by the late Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid. This neo-futuristic cultural complex was commissioned to replace the Dongdaemun Stadium, built during Japanese rule in the 1920s, and was created in Hadid’s signature curvaceous forms. Dongdaemun is a busy and historic neighbourhood in central Seoul’s Jongno-gu district, which is known for its 24-hour shopping. The DPP complex includes a much-needed green oasis within the densely built South Korean capital. During the site’s excavation, major archaeological remains from the Joseon dynasty were uncovered, including original sections of the Seoul City Wall, which have been incorporated into the park.

The migrants walked in an organized fashion and were escorted by local police along the highway linking the Guatemalan border with Tapachula. @magnumphotos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

Allagash means “bark stream” in the native Penobscot language; in the image is a handmade birch bark canoe. This year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which preserved certain stretches of our rivers. I am honored to have shot images for five U.S. postal stamps, to be issued next year, of designated Wild and Scenic Rivers in recognition of the importance of preserving these wilderness areas. #rivers  #wilderness  #maine  #Allagash  #preservation  #nature  #moonlight                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "63   Photo by @brentstirton | This #blackrhino  lost its horn to #poachers  in #Zimbabwe . They left the animal for dead with multiple AK47 bullet wounds. This bull recovered briefly and walked through the bush for nearly a week in unimaginable pain and confusion. There were maggots breeding in his face when he finally died. We all lost another severely endangered black rhino bull to this incident, further depleting the gene pool of a magnificent species that we are losing. It’s no secret that rhinos are severely endangered today, yet China recently declared that it will once again allow trading of rhino and tiger parts domestically after a 25-year ban. They say this is to accommodate “farmed animals” bred in China. There are many reports on those farms, none of them good. Issues of severe inbreeding, starvation, and other abuses are common. There are also many reports that wild animals fetch higher prices on the Chinese market. Any legalization of these animal products throws open large loopholes for the illegal trade, stimulating poaching against severely endangered animals in countries that feed the illegal wildlife trade flowing into China. This is a very disappointing decision on the part of #China , especially so soon after they agreed to ban their domestic #Ivory  trade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "65   Photo by Stephen Alvarez @salvarezphoto | A weaver in the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco near Cusco, Peru. When I first went to Peru for @natgeo it was to photograph an expedition to the Andes that was recovering Inca mummies from high altitude burials south of Cusco. One of them became known as the Peruvian Ice Maiden. Maybe because it was my first National Geographic assignment, but I have always felt a strong connection with her. She was a girl of 16 wrapped in exquisitely woven textiles frozen into the 21,000-foot summit ridge of Mountt Ampato. The weaving tradition was strong in this part of the Andes for centuries, but by the time I arrived it had languished. With a grant from National Geographic, the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco has helped revive, preserve, and pass on the Andean weaving tradition. The women of this cooperative still dye yarn in the traditional way. Their work is wonderful. Today they make a replica of the Ice Maiden's wrappings. Seeing a copy of her wrappings brought back a flood of memories from that first assignment. Of course I’m bringing a set home. #Peru                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Across Cuba, a land soaked in politics, music and \"caught in time,\" it is the warmth of the people that stands out. U.S. relations with Cuba warmed in recent years, but have since declined. Cuba's economy has dipped, but somehow the spirit of the people remains positive. \"I choose optimism,\" one friend told me. \"I have no other choice.\" To see more, follow @pedrombride. #havana  #cuba  #travel  #reflection  #positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "67   Photo by @CristinaMittermeier | Icebergs fill Antarctic waters like tall, icy buildings of a polar city. Their elegance is shaped by the elements of this frigid climate, but they are much more than simply beautiful. Icebergs are a haven and home to many Antarctic animals, such as these sleepy crabeater seals. However, as we find our global temperatures rising, the ice, which is so vital to Antarctic life, is melting faster and faster, and the impacts associated with these rapid changes are becoming imminent.

       "68   Photo by Anastasia Taylor-Lind @anastasiatl | When Alina and Igor Leschina decided to marry this summer in Avdeevka, an industrial city in eastern Ukraine, they had two venue options: the local registry office with two small, dark rooms in a building that had been shelled, or the community center down the street. In the end, they chose the center—generally considered a more pleasant venue, despite being next to a minefield. After signing their marriage certificate, the bride and groom bowed to their parents. “Now that you are married to each other, don’t forget to call your parents,” said the registrar who married them, “and come to visit them.” That simple advice to the newlyweds, the kind that most newlyweds elsewhere may receive, was also a reminder that in these front-line areas of a war that has simmered for years, many young people leave for safer places while their parents stay behind. It has been more than four years since the war in Ukraine began. The front line is static and life around it is pretty normal—or so it seems. People in conflict zones get used to danger. Like everywhere else, they work, cook, have fun, fall in love, get married and raise children.

       "69   Photo by @stevewinterphoto | On October 29th, the government of China revealed that it will allow commercial trade in tiger bone and rhino horn from farmed animals for use in traditional Chinese medicine research and clinical treatments. Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.” China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them). This will further the trade in wild tigers, as the “wild tiger” will now be more valuable than farmed. @natgeo @stevewinterphoto @wildaid @eia_news                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "70   Video by Moises Saman @moisessaman | Central American migrants, part of a caravan of thousands determined to reach the US border, catch a ride on top of a trailer truck as it drives north near the town of Los Corazones, Oaxaca state, Mexico on Nov. 5, 2018. Some truck drivers, and other passing people with space on their vehicles, offer rides to the caravan of migrants, allowing them to advance at a faster pace than walking. This is a very dangerous form of transportation, and migrants have been spotted sitting on the roofs of truck cabins, crouching in between the axis of trailer trucks, or holding on to any surface that allows them to ride rather than walk.

       "71   Photo by @brentstirton | This is an image of over 40 lion bone carcasses to be sent to China from South Africa for their #traditionalmedicine  market. #Lionbone  has come to replace much of the #tigerbone  trade as tigers are so severely endangered in the wild. China recently declared that it will once again allow trading of rhino and tiger parts domestically after a 25-year ban. They say this is to accommodate “farmed animals” bred in China. There are many reports on those farms, none of them good. Issues of severe inbreeding, starvation, and other abuses are common. There are also many reports that wild animals fetch higher prices on the Chinese market. Any legalization of these animal products throws open large loopholes for the illegal trade, stimulating poaching against severely endangered animals in countries that feed the illegal wildlife trade flowing into China. This is a very disappointing decision on the part of #China , especially so soon after they agreed to ban their domestic #Ivory  trade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "73   Photo by @joelsartore | Did you know word “lemur” comes from the Latin word for ghost? Nocturnal behavior, startling screams, and mythology regarding some lemur species as holding the spirits of ancestors are thought to contribute to their ghostly name connection. The aye-aye is at the center of countless myths on the island of Madagascar, with many locals holding the belief that an encounter with the aye-aye brings great misfortune. Some Malagasy even believe that the aye-ayes are man-eaters, which is why you should never leave your village in the dark. In reality, the aye-aye leads a solitary life and is nocturnal, meaning an encounter with this unique lemur is rare. With increased education and ecotourism to Madagascar, there is hope that this species will be viewed as a treasure and not as a threat.

       "74   Photo by @beverlyjoubert | They say an elephant never forgets. Elephants certainly don't seem to forget when a favorite food source becomes available. The Makalani palms (Hyphaene petersiana) that are great features of this northern Botswana landscape produce copious amounts of fruit that generally ripen at the driest time of the year, when other food sources are scant. It's not uncommon to see elephants shaking each tree to check whether the fruit has ripened and will fall. This bull has tested them all and will be back to investigate again, until the fruits rain down on him. #thebeautyofelephants  #realfanpalm  #makalanipalm  #wintersday  #botswana  #linyantiswamps  #selindareserve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "75   Photo by @ciriljazbec | A white horse runs by while trekking to a remote settlement of Laya in the north of the country. Here in Bhutan they never tie their horses; they simply allow their animals to roam free. When they need to use them, they will just climb the mountains to find them. This social norm has recently become part of the environmental chapter in Bhutan’s new constitution that also includes concrete sustainable solutions—to set a network of biological corridors where animals are allowed to roam free throughout the country.

       "76   Photo by @stevewinterphoto | On October 29th, the government of China revealed that it will allow commercial trade in tiger bone and rhino horn from farmed animals for use in traditional Chinese medicine research and clinical treatments. Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.” China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them). This will further the trade in wild tigers, as the “wild tiger” will now be more valuable than farmed. @natgeo @stevewinterphoto @wildaid @eia_news                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

The forty or so residents called themselves the Diggers, after a group of land rights activists who occupied an area just a few miles away in 1649. The original Diggers believed that land had become over-privatized. As long as they were cultivating and caring for the area they inhabited, they claimed, they had a right to remain. While the 21st century community made a similar argument, they were eventually evicted from the property in September, 2015.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "84   Photo @tbfrost | When forests are cut and burned, slow-moving creatures, especially reptiles, often are caught in the fires and burned alive. In this photo @harry__turner is holding the remains of an 8-foot red tail boa constrictor we found on the edge of a forest that had been in flames just days before. Smoke was rising from the earth and the ground was still hot to the touch. There was no color, just black and grey. The scene suggested the snake had slithered as fast as possible to make it to the river, but that the burns to over half its body overwhelmed it, and the beautiful creature died just a few feet from safety. The sadness amongst us was such that one could feel it in the air. The hardest part wasn’t that they died but how they died. In one hour of searching a football field-sized clearing, @harry__turner, @melissalesh, and I found 4 dead snakes, 4 dead yellow footed tortoises, dozens of lizards and rodents, and hundreds of insects. The loss of rainforest alone gives all of us, including me, good reason to think more carefully about the sources of the things we buy. But knowing so many animals meet their end like this has renewed my vigilance to be a more careful consumer. Head on over to @tbfrost to see a happier photograph of this same species of boa alive and well, living in a national park. #snakes  #snakesofinstagram  #rainforest  #peru  #snek  #fires  #deforestation  #reptiles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "85   Photo by @beverlyjoubert | It looks like a snarl, but it is in fact a response to pheromones known as the \"\"flehmen\"\" response. This is seen in a number of mammals and most cats (including house cats), and allows them to check the reproductive or territorial status of others. Both males and females will bare their teeth like this when they come across a scent that gives them a chemical signal. This dominant male is testing the pheromones in the urine of a female who is coming into estrus and, after sensing her readiness, will track her very closely.

       "87   Photo by @lynseyaddario | I photographed women in Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world for my @natgeo story ‘Veiled Rebellion’. Pictured above, Noor Nisa, eighteen (right), was in labor and stranded with her mother in Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan, November 2009. Her husband’s first wife died during childbirth, so he was determined to get her to the hospital, a four-hour drive from their village. His borrowed car broke down and I ended up taking them to the hospital, where Noor Nisa delivered a baby girl. #photojournalism  #itswhatido  #lynseyaddario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "88   Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Jaguars love the water. This male jag is looking for caiman for her dinner—while a female waits on the bank. Shot in August in the Pantanal of Brazil. Our animal family is so much like us: They find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel, and have emotions, we will all be better humans. We need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not. Jaguars are the third largest of the big cats. They are found from the U.S./Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in Brazil's Patanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguar's range. Poaching for skins, bones, and teeth is also growing for the first time since the 1970s to feed the demand of people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth,” Chinese traditional medicine, and now luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid My first story with big cats was the first @natgeo jaguar story 20 years ago! It has changed my life working with the magical and magnificent cats of the world. Animals have emotions just like we have.

       "90   Video by Moises Saman @moisessaman | Salvadoran migrants crossing the Suchiate river which is the border between Guatemala and Mexico on Nov. 2, 2018. These migrants are part of a caravan of over a thousand people that left San Salvador on Oct. 30, 2018. They are determined to reach the United States. The Suchiate river demarcates the border between Guatemala and Mexico near the Mexican city of Tapachula. The caravan decided to cross the border illegally after Mexican immigration authorities offered them asylum in Mexico, but not safe passage to the United States. @magnumphotos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "91   Photo by Michaela Skovranova @mishkusk | Green turtles are thought to live for up to 80 years. What a different ocean that would have been when they dipped their head underwater for the first time. Like other sea turtles, the females return to the very same beach on which they were hatched to lay their eggs, often covering hundreds of kilometers in the process. This photograph showcases a young green turtle that has been successfully released back into the wild with a temporary satellite tracker attached. The tracker will collect valuable information that will allow researchers to track where the turtles are, the route they have traveled, and how fast they may be moving. #ocean  #turtle  #shellybeach  #australia  #sydney  #nature  #wildlife  #marinesanctuary  #naturelovestories                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "92   Photo by Pete McBride @pedromcbride | Silence is more memorable than the views. “The brush of bat wings in the morning over your head. The clatter of sheep hooves on the rock across the river. It sounds as if it’s close by, but it’s not,” says McBride. “And then you realize just how quickly that silence can be shattered.\" From a recent @natgeo story on my Grand Canyon project.

Taken just blocks away from the sprawling Hawassa Industrial Park, this image felt outside of time and made me think of how ones traditions coexist alongside the drive for change. #ethiopia  #economy  #manufacturing  #industry  #tradition  #nicholesobecki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "95   Photo by @PaulNicklen | While photographing at Cooper Bay in Antarctica, I managed to capture this shot of a macaroni penguin’s eye. Although they live in frigid snow and ice, their eyes are a fiery red. These penguins are full of energy and spunk and are distinguishable by the “V” shaped yellow crest located on the centre of their forehead which extends towards the back of their head. #FollowMe  on @PaulNicklen for more photos from the Antarctic and check out @natgeo magazine's November issue for my most recent work in this polar paradise. #penguins  #wildlifephotography  #explore  #Antarctica                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "97   Photo by @pedromcbride | Celebrating Peace: I recently witnessed a remarkable event in northern Kenya where five tribes that have historically fought against each other—put their differences aside and danced—together. Led entirely by women with @nrt_kenya this peace meeting was the first of its kind and a message for young and old men, and women alike to work together to protect their world and the natural world that sustains them, including wildlife, water and grasslands. Under the glow of car lights, these pastoral women danced into the night, all singing traditional songs and creating new ones. @usaid #inspired  #hope  #kenya  #africa  #dance  #peace  #petemcbride                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "99   Wild_Life with @bertiegregory // After six days of being thrown around the cabin of our 50ft sailboat in the waves of the South Atlantic Ocean, we finally spotted land. Having spent the last few days with my head in a bucket, the sight of South Georgia Island’s massive cliff faces and stunning glaciers was as much a relief as it was spectacular! Partnered with epic scenery, this island is home to one of the highest concentrations of wildlife on the planet. Given this and its remoteness, you would be forgiven for thinking it has always been an untouched wilderness. Unfortunately this is not the case. We humans hunted the whales and seals to near extinction and introduced an army of egg eating rats that ran riot through the ground nesting bird colonies. Whilst South Georgia is a document of the worse of human nature, it is also a document of the best. Thanks to protection and hard work from a special group of people, the island’s wildlife has made a remarkable recovery. // Check out the new season of Wild_Life at natgeo.com/wildlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "102  Photo by @pedromcbride (Pete McBride) | Silence is more memorable than the views. “The brush of bat wings in the morning over your head. The clatter of sheep hooves on the rock across the river. It sounds as if it’s close by, but it’s not,” says McBride. “And then you realize just how quickly that silence can be shattered.\" From the latest @natgeo interview about my new book on the Grand Canyon.

       "104  Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio | Sasso Barisano, The City of Matera, Basilicata, Italy. Known as \"la Città Sotterranea\" (the Subterranean City), the city is centred on the \"Sassi di Matera\" (meaning \"The Stones of Matera\"). The Sassi originate from a prehistoric troglodyte settlement, and are suspected to be some of the first human settlements in Italy, Indeed, Matera is the only place in the world where people can boast to be still living in the same houses of their ancestors of 9,000 years ago. Miserably poor throughout the centuries, and a burden on the national psyche, the Sassi were forcibly cleared in the 1950s, but in recent years have seen the return of tourists, boutique hotels and Hollywood film crews. Matera is European Capital of Culture for 2019.

       "105  Project by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | SOUND ON! This is a small sample clip of a 360 experience we built as part of my current cover story in @natgeo magazine (Nov). You are looking at a perfectly preserved Kiva, or underground ceremony room, in #BearsEarsNationalMonument , Utah, with storytelling by @marlon.magdalena from Jemez Pueblo. While this looks like a video, the world you move through is actually a virtual model that takes you into the various rooms of the 800-1000 year old Ancestral Pueblo site. This model (and many others) will be shared with Pueblo communities across the South West. We're especially hoping to share it with school children and elders who might not be capable of making the journey to their ancestral homelands. To learn more about how to experience the full interactive version of this and other sites follow @argonautphoto. My partner in this project was @devlin_gandy and we were able to make this experience thanks to funding from @InsideNatGeo, National Geographic magazine, and @NatGeoMuseum and the final 360 video with the help of @max.salomon! Special thanks to our field producer and cultural advisor Kevin Madalena (@jemezscientist_occamschainsaw), @protectbearsears, and @cedarmesafriends!

       "106  Photo by @amivitale | It is devastating to hear that China has decided to reverse its 25-year-old ban on the sale and use of rhinoceros and tiger products. The reversal allows for these products to be used in medical research or healing, uses long since proven to have no benefits to humans. This change will certainly lead to more pressure on already terribly vulnerable animal populations and place in greater danger the conservationists, rangers and communities who fight for the survival of these majestic creatures. Here, Sudan, the last living male Northern White Rhino left on this planet is comforted moments before he passed away March 19, 2018 in northern Kenya. Sudan was brought to Kenya from @safari_park_dvur_kralove in the #Czechrepublic  in 2009. He died surrounded by people who loved him at @olpejeta and has been an inspirational figure for many across the world. If there is any meaning in his death, its that Sudan can be our final wake up call. In a world of 7 billion, we need to start recognizing that we are not separate from nature. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then saving nature is really about saving ourselves. Today, fewer 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild. We are witnessing extinction on our watch and must help them by speaking out and supporting conservation efforts worldwide, especially among the indigenous communities who are on the front lines every day against poaching.

       "107  Photo by @geosteinmetz | Majiek Gai Chan, 15, lies on the ground after being cut with the knife that will mark him as a man in #Nuer  society. This ancient custom was once common throughout #SouthSudan , but has become increasingly rare as youth choose to keep their tribal identity more private and become socially accepted in the modern world. The boys are cut in birth order, and were all eager to follow the tradition of their people. Shortly after the cutting, one proud father sacrificed a cow to celebrate the manhood of his first son, and shared the meat with the village. #anthropology  in the 21st Century.

       "108  Photo by @enricsala | The planet is in a conservation crisis. We have killed 90 percent of the large fish in the ocean since 1900, and terrestrial vertebrates have declined by 60% since 1970. But there's still time to protect and restore the health of our natural world. Protected areas can bring wildlife back, and help give us oxygen, clean water, and mitigate climate change. That's why we're proud to work with the Wyss Campaign for Nature to help conserve 30% of our planet's waters and lands by 2030.

Known for its Italian Renaissance architecture, Telč is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The town was founded in the 13th century as a royal water fort on the crossroads of busy merchant routes between Bohemia, Moravia and Austria and is now a stopping point on the road from Vienna to Prague. #followme  @irablockphoto to see more images from the world. @thephotosociety @natgeoimagecollection #telč  #czechrepublic  #unesco  #unescoworldheritagesite  #architecture  #refelctions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "113  Photo by Federico Rios @historiassencillas | Traveling from the Orinoco Delta (in northern Venezuela) to the Brazilian border in the south is a long and difficult trip that lasts about three days. Without money, indigenous families seeking refuge have to sleep in improvised places and use all methods of transportation – busses, private cars, hitchhiking and walking on foot – to reach the border. Here, Delia Estrella travels with her granddaughter Ingrid Moraleda in a 4x4 truck traveling from Las Claritas to Santa Elena at the Venezuelan side of the border. This was the first time Delia had left her home in the Orinoco Delta – perhaps she will never return.

       "115  Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | A white rhino is dehorned at a rhino farm, Klerksdorp, NW Province, South Africa - Yesterday, the Chinese government made a devastating announcement reversing a 25 year ban on the sale and use of Rhinoceros and Tiger products. It will allow the use of powdered rhino horns and tiger bones for “medical research or in healing” from farmed rhinos and tigers in government certified Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) hospitals - In a statement announcing the replacement of the 25-year old ban, the State Council said powdered forms of rhino horn and bones from dead tigers could be used in \"qualified hospitals by qualified doctors”. The animal products can only be obtained from farms, it said, and added ‘“parts from those animals classified as ‘antiques' could be used in cultural exchanges if approved by the cultural authorities. Even if restricted to antiques and use in hospitals, this trade will surely increase confusion by consumers and law enforcers as to which products are, and are not legal, and would likely expand the markets for other tiger and rhino products.

After her mother was killed by poachers, Shaba was brought to Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e) in 2016. Initially wary of the keepers, Shaba is now an instrumental part of the sanctuary, helping to keep order, teaching the young ones how to navigate steep paths and greeting new orphans with a heartfelt and emotional hello. Shaba guides her fellow elephants as they adapt to life at the sanctuary in addition to helping teach the keepers how to better care for their charges.

       "117  Photo by @chamiltonjames | A pack of 14 African wild dogs head out to hunt on the flood pain of @gorongosapark in Mozambique this morning at dawn. They had already killed and eaten a young waterbuck when I took this shot and shortly after they killed a reedbuck. The wild dogs have been reintroduced to Gorongosa National Park after years of absence. The enormous abundance of prey animals and lack of competition, particularly from hyenas, means that the wild dog pack is thriving. Hunting for them is easy and they seem to be picky about what they eat as a result. Shot for an @natgeo story on Gorongosa National Park that will come out next year.

       "124  Photo by @maggiesteber | “If you long for a mind at rest and a heart that cannot harden…go find a gate that opens wide into a secret garden.” - Author Unknown. A variety of leaves, seeds, bugs, bird eggs and even the chest bone from a chicken collected from the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma, a personal project that I began a couple of years ago to deal with a buildup of having witnessed a mixture of both the worst and the best of humankind. Many photographers have personal projects and it is these in which instead of telling the stories of others, we tell our own stories in whatever form we please. This is what the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma is for me. In my career I have covered everything from war to fashion and seen great suffering and violence. I have told stories about heroic figures and those who were beaten down by life. We photographers choose to be in places where we see suffering and glory and to bear witness. But these things impact us in unexpected ways including a kind of longing for normality or loneliness or missing home or feeling completely disconnected from the world. We don’t realize the toll it takes on us until we are forced to face it. In the past two years alongside regular assignments, sometimes challenging ones, I decided I needed to play, to plant the seeds of new ideas, to be wild at heart without having to make excuses or explain myself, to tell my own story or a part of it. I created The Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma. Lily is my alter ego in an alternate universe. She is everything I am not….or maybe she is everything I am. It doesn’t matter, it is a release from this world and a visit into my wild imagination. #secretgarden  #lilylapalma  #imagination  #innerpeace  #myownstory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "126  Photo by @joelsartore | If you’re ever nervous about taking that extra bathroom break at work, just be grateful you aren’t the brown-throated three-toed sloth! These guys literally risk their lives to defecate, which is why it only happens every eight days. Using the bathroom means venturing out of the treetops and down onto the forest floor where they become twice as vulnerable to depredation by jaguars and harpy eagles. Luckily, sloths have an extremely slow metabolism and a diet low in calories meaning long waits to use the bathroom aren’t an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "127  Photo by Charlie Hamilton James @chamiltonjames | A pack of African wild dogs heads out onto the flood plain in @gorongosapark at dusk to hunt. All fourteen members of the pack were brought to Gorongosa as part of an ongoing reintroduction program, which aims to bring the park back to its former glory. It once boasted some of the most spectacular wildlife in Africa but most of it's wildlife was lost during years of civil war. Now many years later, Gorongosa is thriving again, thanks to careful management and investment in local communities. Shortly after this photo was taken the dogs took down a bush buck. African wild dogs are incredibly effective hunters - able to run up to 40 mph for long distances, which gives them the ability to exhaust their prey and overwhelm them. The story of @gorongosapark will feature in @natgeo magazine nest year.

       "129  Photo by @ronan_donovan | This Yellowstone wolf is known as Mr. Blue. He was born a black wolf and his fur has changed from black to this cool steely blue-gray color. He’s lived most of his life within the borders of Yellowstone National Park and throughout that time he's had at least 6 different female mates. Some have been killed by rival packs, some killed by human hunters and one was taken stolen by a rival pack. One of the most amazing aspects of Mr. Blue’s character is that he has this ability to mingle his way into existing wolf packs.

       "131  Photo by @hammond_robin for @onedayinmyworld | “I didn’t understand what was happening. My neighbors pushed me on the boat to save my life. We could not bring one piece of clothing.” Suru Jaman fled from Myanmar after the “ethnic cleansing” perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya sparked a massive refugee crisis. Suru, along with nearly a million other Rohingya, now lives in the sprawling refugee camp over the border in Bangladesh. “I’m here with my 19 year old daughter. My husband is dead... he was killed by those people.” The loss has taken a severe psychological toll: “Whenever I remember the things that happened I feel like killing myself, stabbing myself in the chest.” But at least the family is safe now, says Suru: “We were not peaceful back there. We are peaceful now. We can eat and pray.” // #inmyworld  is designed to expose the challenges faced by people living with #mentalhealth  issues and give them the chance to be seen, heard and valued. @witness_change is a nonprofit that aims to improve life for excluded groups by amplifying their stories.

       "132  Photo by @stevewinterphoto | @Zakouma_National_Park in Chad, @africanparksnetwork, is one of the most amazing ecosystems on the planet – the amazing abundance of life found here is off the charts. Zakouma is just one of 15 parks managed by conservation NGO African Parks (@africanparksnetwork). If you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to Zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. Tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods. What is happening in Zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. The park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory – and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016. Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

       "135  Photo by @CarltonWard | Did you know that the first modern cattle and horses in the United States landed on the Gulf coast of Florida in 1521? Ponce de Leon brought them on sailing ships from Spain during his second voyage to the New World. Although he was attacked by Calusa Indians (and later died of his wounds in Havana), cattle and horses remained. When my ancestors migrated into Florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the Florida woods for nearly three centuries. Descendants of these original Spanish livestock are called \"\"cracker\"\" cattle and horses today. Early American settlers of the Florida frontier were also called \"\"crackers\"\", attributed to the \"\"crack\"\" of their cow whips. Modern horses actually evolved in North America but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. Much of the southeastern US was adapted to grazers. There were herds of wild bison in Florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). There are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the Northern Everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems. Cattle grazing in this region has been shown by @ArchboldStation to increase net carbon sequestration by grasslands. Ranches here also provide important wildlife habitat for bears, panthers and other native species while protecting land from development in the #FloridaWildlifeCorridor .

       "136  Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | When sailing in calm seas there was something really comforting about snuggling down into a nice warm sleeping bag on this top bunk. Gina found time to read the classic Three Men in a Boat, which seemed quite appropriate for this expedition. In rough seas, however, things were very different. Trying to find a stable position to go to sleep without being thrown around was very difficult. In these situations Gina would move to the floor where she could pen herself in so that she wasn’t sliding around. Either way, from here on she would be sleeping on dry land. #EAGRE18  @greenland_caves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "138  Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Too close for comfort! @Zakouma_National_Park in Chad, @africanparksnetwork, is one of the most amazing ecosystems on the planet – the amazing abundance of life found here is off the charts. Zakouma is just one of 15 parks managed by conservation NGO African Parks (@africanparksnetwork). If you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to Zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. Tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods. What is happening in Zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. The park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory – and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016. Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

       "142  Photo by Daniella Zalcman @dzalcman | Tlingit elder Bob Sam says a prayer at the gravesite of a Native Alaskan child who died while attending the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. This month marks the 100th anniversary of the closing of Carlisle, which was the first government off-reservation Indian boarding school in the United States — it would become the model for future boarding schools throughout the U.S. and Canada. Roughly 12,000 Native children attended, many of whom were taken from their families and communities by force in the name of coercive assimilation. This cemetery near where the school once stood is home to the graves of 184 students. Mr. Sam has spent the past 30 years working to help identify and repatriate the remains of children who died while at boarding schools across the country.

       "144  Photo by @FransLanting | When you follow emperor penguins on their arduous journeys between their colonies at the edge of Antarctica and the open water where they forage, you get a good sense of how they navigate across the fractured icescapes of the Weddell Sea. There are no straight lines between colony and ocean. I marveled at the ability of this small party to find the best way across pressure ridges. Emperor penguins are uniquely dependent on sea ice. That’s where they raise their young. With the rapid melting of Antarctica’s sea ice, their future hangs in the balance.

       "147  Photo by @nicholesobecki | Ayan Abdi shares a laugh with her closest friend Maryan Hassan, a teacher at Horyaal Secondary School in Dadaab refugee camp, Kenya. Both women applied for a @wusc_eumc scholarship to study in Canada last year, but only Ayan was accepted. Two friends, both of who had lived most of their lives confined to one of the world’s largest refugee camps on the Somali border, both trying to find a way out. On that day their path divided. Ayan had won the golden ticket to a new life, and Maryan would remain in Dadaab. It was a bittersweet moment after following their application process for months. We recently received news that I’m thrilled to share here. After applying again for this highly competitive scholarship Maryan was accepted and will join Ayan in Canada to study, and gain a pathway to resettlement. Sometimes, against all the odds, the good gals win. #welcomerefugees  #education  #kenya  #somalia  #canada                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "149  Video by @drewtrush | Wait for it……🔊on! • • • A cougar scares off a group of eagles feeding on an elk kill and you can hear the alarm call of the raven's warning.…. Perhaps the best part of my job is the relationships that I get to form with the folks that I’ve worked with. @yellowstone_cougar_project has been one of the best groups of researchers I’ve had the pleasure of being around. Dr. Dan Stahler, and (soon to be Dr.) Colby Anton @cobblestonetosandweasel have led a group of dedicated scientists and technicians with the goal of learning more about the cougars of @yellowstonenps northern range. I helped iron out the kinks in their camera trapping operation in the beginning with the help of an @insidenatgeo grant, and now we just can’t quit talking about how much fun we had, as well as how these animals continue to amaze us. We're so thankful we can share it with you. #gratitude  #cougars  #cats  #catsofinstagram  #justwait  #commonground  #publiclands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

As today’s NYTimes Op Ed states: “The film is a drug. It causes your pupils to dilate, your palms to sweat, and your mind to boggle. Even as you know that Honnold is going to make it to the top, you can’t believe what you’re seeing — a young man, millimeters from extinction, transforming the unthinkable into the sublime. “Free Solo” is 97 minutes long and if you could hold your breath the whole time you probably would.” #FreeSolo  continues it’s expansion nationwide this weekend.

       "151  Photo by @chien_chi_chang | I have been working in New York’s Chinatown since 1992—for more than 26 years—and it is still a project in progress. I have followed and photographed twenty families in Chinatown, and those relationships are now culminating in a tri-generational drama. The people in these pictures were all willing to sacrifice their immediate comfort to realize the dream of giving their children a \"\"better\"\" life. Some of that first wave of immigrants have now returned to China to enjoy the rest of their lives in prosperity, with family members they have not seen for decades. Others are trying to live the American dream. #MagnumPhotos  #cccontheroad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

The film is still on the festival tour but we will keep y’all posted when mainstream distribution is locked in! ~ Pictured here is The Last Honey Hunter himself, Mauli Dhan, after his final honey harvest and probably the last one for his shamanistic culture in remote eastern Nepal. Witnessing him climb rope-less on wet rock while being swarmed by hundreds of thousands of bees to continue the tradition of gathering hallucinogenic honey was nothing short of magical. ~ With Director @ben_knight, @jetbutterflies @camp4collective @feltsoulmedia @travisrummel @taylorfreesolo @sadiequarrier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "154  Photo by @Hammond_Robin for @ICRC | “As we fled, I lost my husband,” says 27-year-old Iraqi mother of six Sara Ali describing the battle that engulfed her village. “Now, he is missing. It is better to live under siege than to lose a husband.” Sara poses in front of a blanket her mother gave her as a wedding present. As Sara and her family fled the fighting, the men were separated from the women and children. Eight months later, Sara and her children returned home to find it had been looted. They live in poverty awaiting the return of her husband. “I hope that you will never witness what we have experienced in this war.” . With the end of combat operations, Iraq is hoping to break the cycles of violence that reach back to the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. These conflicts have caused immense suffering for civilians: millions have fled their homes, livelihoods have been destroyed and large numbers have been killed and wounded. . Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. While living with and reacting to those consequences, women are hardly passive victims, though.

       "156  Wild_Life with @bertiegregory // Argued to be the busiest beach in the world, St Andrews bay is home to over 400,000 king penguins. It’s hard to believe that in 1925, just 1,100 kings were counted here. This is what happens when environmental conditions are right and you protect a place. Hats off to the South Georgia Government and all the awesome NGOs that have contributed to this success story. Pictured is one of these adult king penguins feeding its chick. The meal probably consists of their primary prey here, lanternfish. // Check out the new season of Wild_Life at natgeo.com/wildlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Kayapo communities are matriarchal and girls learn primarily from their mothers and sisters. These girls may have fewer opportunities than girls elsewhere, but that doesn’t stop them from living their lives to the fullest.

Once released, she will be monitored by scientists and tracked with a radio collar to make sure she thrives. This species is protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981, yet habitat loss and the spread of disease is causing a population decline. Wildwood Trust has joined forces with a number of conservation organizations to combat this trend and has successfully bred and released red squirrels into the wild.

       "159  Photo by @Hammond_Robin for @ICRC | “I am a victim and I am a survivor,” says Eufamia Cullamat from Surigao del Sur province in Mindanao, Philippines. Three years ago, Eufamia watched as her cousin, an anti-mining activist, was shot in the head in front of her village. Now, the 57-year-old farmer carries on his cause to stop extraction companies from encroaching on their land. “The only thing we’re asking for is respect and our right to make our own decisions,” she says. // For nearly five decades, the Philippine government has been engaged in armed conflicts in the southern region of Mindanao. The prolonged conflicts, rooted deeply in disputes over land, political and religious ideology, have resulted in thousands of people being killed, with many more enduring repeated displacement and hardship. // Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. Women are hardly passive victims though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. // This work was made with the support of the International Committee of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organization working on all sides of conflict to alleviate people’s suffering.

       "160  Photo by @amivitale | In 2014, I witnessed a group of Samburu warriors encounter a rhino for the first time in their lives at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (@lewa_wildlife). Only their grandfathers saw rhinos in the wild and these young men had never even seen a photo of one. Based on stories and their own imaginations, they expected the young rhinos to be as big as elephants, as dangerous as lions and for their horns to be flexible, like an elephant's trunk. Much-needed attention has been focused on the plight of wildlife, but very little has been said about the indigenous communities on the frontlines of the poaching wars. The Nature Conservancy in Africa (@nature_africa), the Northern Rangelands Trust (@nrt_kenya) and Lewa are doing incredible work to strengthen these communities, who hold the key to saving Africa's great animals. Together we can work to save them - visit and support the communities that protect them.

       "161  Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio | The City of Matera, Basilicata, Italy. Known as \"la Città Sotterranea\" (the Subterranean City), the city is centred on the \"Sassi di Matera\" (meaning \"The Stones of Matera\"). The Sassi originate from a prehistoric troglodyte settlement, and are suspected to be some of the first human settlements in Italy, Indeed, Matera is the only place in the world where people can boast to be still living in the same houses of their ancestors of 9,000 years ago. Miserably poor throughout the centuries, and a burden on the national psyche, the Sassi were forcibly cleared in the 1950s, but in recent years have seen the return of tourists, boutique hotels and Hollywood film crews. Matera is a candidate for European Capital of Culture for 2019.

       "162  Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | Samburu Lmuget, sasaab village, northern Kenya - I met Jeneria Lekilelei (centre of frame) over a decade ago now whilst sitting under a tree in northern Kenya. I was, I’ll admit, pretty lost. What at first was a slightly nervous moment as this warrior simply came and sat next to me, has over the years developed into a deep respect both for the man and his work with @ewasolions in the Samburu, northern Kenya. The African lion population has declined by 43% in the last 20 years and lions now occupy only 8% of their historical range in Africa. The estimated numbers of lions across Africa are approximately 20,000. In Kenya, the national population now numbers less than 2,000 individuals. At current rates of decline, the species could become extinct here within the next two decades. This reduction in lion numbers is primarily due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, typically when lions kill people’s livestock. Lions and other large carnivores are wide-ranging species, and designated protected areas are often not large enough to ensure their long-term survival. It is crucial, therefore, that conservation of these species, as well as their prey, is addressed throughout the landscape, which not only incorporates protected areas, but also the surrounding areas where local people live. @ewasolions is dedicated to conserving lions and other large carnivores by promoting co-existence between people and wildlife, they work hand-in-hand with local communities to provide education, training and improved conservation practices that help people and wildlife, using sound science to help guide the long-term conservation of lions across community conservancies and protected areas in northern Kenya, and I love their work 👍🏿👍🏼💚to see more of it, follow me here @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @natgeo @everydayextinction @ewasolions #conserving  #conservation  #carnevores  #northernkenya  #kenya                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "163  Photo by @chien_chi_chang | I have been working in New York’s Chinatown since 1992—for more than 26 years—and it is still a project in progress. Immigration is often propelled by suffering. To witness the shifting patterns of populations is to see the world in all its exigencies—war, natural disasters, repression, famine, poverty and persecution. But there is a rainbow at the bottom of that Pandora’s box of troubles; hope, too, propels immigrants to settle in strange lands. I should know: I am one myself. I have followed and photographed twenty families in Chinatown, and those relationships are now culminating in a tri-generational drama. The people in these pictures were all willing to sacrifice their immediate comfort to realize the dream of giving their children a \"better\" life. Some of that first wave of immigrants have now returned to China to enjoy the rest of their lives in prosperity, with family members they have not seen for decades. Others are trying to live the American dream. The common thread, the universal quality in this work, is the essential human need to hold hope in your hands. #MagnumPhotos  #cccontheroad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Yet somehow this photo feels as familiar to me as a snapshot of the Brooklyn Bridge. I often fly along this same route through these same mountains in the same bush plane. From way up high, I fantasize about how I would know exactly where I was if I found myself in the valleys thousands of feet below. The reality of course is that I have no idea what lies beneath me in the beautiful and brutal landscape of the Alaska Range, or for that matter the majority of Alaska's approximate 50 million square miles of wilderness. // T.

       "169  Photo by @williamalbertallard | South Dakota, 2006. The picture of hunters seen in their blaze orange garments, shotguns held aloft, just beyond the pickup truck in the foreground with a pheasant rooster lying still alongside a bale of straw, was not published in the essay I did called \"Hunters,\" published in the November, 2007 issue of National Geographic. Both the magazine designer and I wanted this to be the lead picture but it lost out to another image of mine featuring hunters in a vast central Montana field rehabbed by the conservation group @pheasants_forever. The beauty of the pheasant is apparent in even in death although the brilliance of its coloration I believe lessens in death. When I was assigned to do the photography for this essay I really thought it would be popular with readers. I feared the recoil by those who might find killing a deer, such a graceful and docile animal, very distasteful if displayed in the magazine. I could not have been more wrong. The story \"Hunters\" received more mail than any other story published that year and response by readers was six to one positive. I believe the reason was very much influenced by the information given in the article about how hunting is part of the overall effort of conservation and managing wildlife in our country; from license fees wildlife refuges are helped to benefit bird watchers and those who simply enjoy the many areas set aside for wildlife habitat. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of \"Hunters\" and other assignments spanning a five-decade career. @thephotosociety #hunter  #pheasants  #southdakota  #pheasanthunting  #birdhunting  #blazeorange  #onassingment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "170  Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Jaguars love the water - this male jag is looking for caiman for his dinner - shot in August in the Pantanal of Brazil. Our animal family is so much like us - they find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel and have emotions we will all be better humans. We need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not. Jaguars are the 3rd largest of the big cats. Found from US / Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in this area where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range. Also poaching for skins, bones and teeth is growing for the first time since the 1970’s to feed the demand for people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth”, Chinese Traditional Medicine and now Luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid My first story with big cats was the 1st @natgeo Jaguar story 20 years ago! It has changed my life working with the magical and magnificent cats of the world. Animals have emotions just like we have.

       "172  Photo by @PaulNicklen | A pod of narwhals gathers at the surface for a quick breath before returning under the sea ice. These beautiful and elusive whales can be recognized by their unicorn-like tusk, which is used as a tool to hunt their primary prey: polar cod. Narwhals rely heavily on the presence of sea ice as the polar cod life cycle is completely tied to the ice. It’s heartbreaking to realize the spiral of consequences associated with the impacts of climate change, especially as it relates to one of our oceans most majestic marine animals. From the Arctic to the Antarctic, the planet's polar regions are under threat from climate change.

       "173  Photo @tbfrost | A green striped vine snake curled safely in the hands of @harry__turner, who found it during a night walk on conservation land along the Las Piedras river in the Western Amazon of Peru. The land is protected and studied by Peruvian non-profit @hojanueva. This snake is not dangerous to humans as it is only mildly venomous (meaning the venom can kill frogs and other small creatures) and has rear fangs. The body is long and thin and flat, similiar to a ribbon. It spends most of its life in the trees and can extend about 2/3 of its body out to reach distant branches. Must have some seriously strong abs!

We left Ittoqqortoormiit and sailed west along Scoresbysund, where we saw these beautiful icebergs, some of which hidden in cloud. Then we headed north in Hurry Fjord to Constable Point, where we were to meet a helicopter to take us the last bit. It was sad to say goodbye to the boat, the Schwörer family and the dream of sailing all the way to Wagener Halvø, but simply the fjords around the peninsula had not yet cleared of sea ice. @greenland_caves #EAGRE18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "175  Photo by @simoncroberts | Fracking for shale gas has just begun for the first time in the UK since it was linked with earthquakes in 2011. The practice of recovering gas and oil from shale rock has proved controversial with many protestors in Britain trying to halt exploration of new sites over the past few years. The village of Balcombe in Sussex has seen several confrontations between police and anti-fracking protesters with both local inhabitants and members of the Frack Off national movement opposing petroleum gas exploration plans. Here protestors in the ‘No Dash for Gas’ Action Camp' can be seen trying to prevent a vehicle delivering apparatus to the Balcombe site back in 2013.

       "176  Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio on assignment for an upcoming story for @natgeo | The best thing about being back in Jerusalem is to experience again the Damascus Gate. Lens-like, it pulls in in Muslims from Salah e-Din Street, Orthodox Jews from Mea She'arim, Christian pilgrims from the hostels on the old Green Line and even the odd National Geographic photographer and squeezes them through this narrow gap in Suleiman the Magnificent's walls. It's like one of those technical drawings of how a jet engine works: it intakes these believers, fires them through grand architecture and ejects them at high energy through the nozzle of El Wad St and down into the Old City and its holy sites. Except instead of thrust it's an engine for producing piety. I think it is the most exciting, jinking left-turn right-turn in History. I'm rooming on the Via Dolorosa and I have my morning coffee to the sound of pilgrims from Romania or Nigeria or Korea, below my window, singing mournfully at the 8th Station of the Cross.

       "177  Photo by @FransLanting | The other night I had the great honor of receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from @nhm_wpy, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition during a ceremony in London’s magnificent Natural History Museum. I was given a wonderful sculpture of a bull elephant. When my partner in life and work @ChristineEckstrom examined it closely, she realized it had been modeled after a photo I had made on assignment for @natgeo years ago of a famous elephant named \"Survivor\" in Zambia’s North Luangwa Valley. Survivor lived through a previous poaching holocaust in the 1980s and he was written up in Mark and Delia Owens' books \"Eye of the Elephant\" and \"Survivor’s Song.\" The bull elephants depicted here, which I photographed in Botswana one memorable evening, lived more tranquil lives thanks to its government’s enlightened policy of putting a moratorium on elephant hunting, but even there the tide is turning. Nearly one hundred elephants were found poached in an area recently that had been a safe haven for years. I’m sharing this image in honor of all elephant champions including the late Paul Allen, and respectfully ask that you consider supporting the organizations that can turn the current poaching crisis around and secure a future for elephants.

       "178  Wild_life with @bertiegregory | Based on wingspan, the wandering albatross is the biggest bird on the planet. With this giant wingspan of more than 11ft, these birds are able to glide effortlessly over the waves for 1000s of miles in search of food. Scientists put heart rate monitors on albatross to gauge their energy expenditure during different activities. The study found that if the wind direction was favorable for the direction the bird wanted to travel, their heart rate was not much higher than when they’re sat on the water resting. This shows that their 11ft wingspan combined with ultra efficient flying techniques allow flight with very little extra energy cost. Nice one nature. We were lucky enough to encounter this beautiful bird during our 6 day crossing to the Island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. // Check out the new season of Wild_Life at natgeo.com/wildlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Nibbling and nudging at my scuba gear and camera, they are endlessly curious, and time slips aways as we enjoy a once in a lifetime visit together. #TurningTheTide  #seal  #nature  #wildlifephotography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "181  Photo by @CristinaMittermeier | Under the heavy rains of the African winter, I watched this southern ground hornbill and his mate make the best of the wet weather. As he made his way across the savannah, he stuffed his beak, stopping every few moments to catch a tasty frog or insect, content to have his beak spilling with frog legs. The couple eventually made their way into the forest, likely to drop off their abundant meal to their nest. #FollowMe  at @CristinaMittermeier for some of my favourite images from around the world. #Kenya  #nature  #wildlife  #photography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Most girls drop out of school when they start their period due to a lack of toilets and privacy. This happens in many parts of the world. India has been grappling with the problem since before it won independence from Great Britain in 1947. “Sanitation is more important than independence,” Mahatma Gandhi said, urging his compatriots to clean up their act. To some extent they have: The percentage of Indians who defecate in the open has declined substantially in recent decades. But with the population growing rapidly, census data suggest that most Indians now live in places where they are more exposed to others’ feces, not less. #india  #sanitation  @noorimages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Immigration is often propelled by suffering. To witness the shifting patterns of populations is to see the world in all its exigencies—war, natural disasters, repression, famine, poverty and persecution. But there is a rainbow at the bottom of that Pandora’s box of troubles; hope, too, propels immigrants to settle in strange lands.

The tears rolled down her cheeks - “You always remember - a mother never forgets her children.” Luzmila’s 15-year-old son was taken away during the years of conflict between the military and the Shinning Path. He was never seen again. Peru’s Ashaninka communities like Luzmila’s, which reside in the country’s jungle regions, were devastated by the conflict. She has never stopped fighting for justice and answers about the disappearance of her son. She is not alone. An estimated 20,000 people are still missing. // Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. Women are hardly passive victims though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. // This work was made with the support of the International Committee of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organization working on all sides of conflict to alleviate people’s suffering.

       "187  Photo by @CarltonWard | I grew up on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It’s where I first fell in love with the water and became a conservationist. Stories from my parents made me realize how much the health of the estuaries and fisheries had degraded in just one generation. For the past dozen years I’ve been focused a bit further inland, working to raise visibility of the Florida Wildlife Corridor — a 17-million acre network of connected wildlife habitat that is very much threatened from expanding roads and development. The Corridor is hidden in plain sight for most of Florida’s 21 million residents and 120 million annual visitors, and same could be said for the Gulf. I am thankful to have experienced the intersection of these two worlds during the 2015 #Glades2Gulf  Expedition (supported by @insidenatgeo). This photo was made on Day 10 of that journey among tendrils of the Chassahowitzska River delta. I couldn’t find my team members to use as subjects during the first of the magical sunrise, so I set my camera on a tripod, started the interval timer and paddled off into the fog. The experience was one of my favorites from the 70-day trek. Later that year, this image was selected as the cover for The Forgotten Coast, made for PBS by @GrizzlyCreekFilms. In many ways, the Gulf of Mexico is America’s Forgotten Coast. Last week the specific region of the Florida panhandle officially known as the Forgotten Coast was devastated by Hurricane Michael. My prayers are with the people, many whom lost their homes. Let us remember and support them.

       "188  Photo by @beverlyjoubert | She's a phenomenal hunter in perfect condition. Like all Okavango lions, her muscles are highly developed from running through water on a daily basis and she is bigger than most lions found in other areas. It is not possible to live in this wet environment without learning to incorporate the water into following prey species and being successful in hunting them. She currently has small cubs tucked away from the rest of the pride and is hunting on her own. @dereckjoubert and I have watched her stalking red lechwe in the deep swamps for hours. She doesn't stop until she is successful. With the very high numbers of lechwe around the island, she also doesn't need to hunt at night and indeed seems to be getting up later and later in the day - often hunting around mid-day. We used to stay with these lions from pre-dawn to film their hunts, but we're learning that right now, when the sun is rising, we too can rest with her. She's not going to move if she doesn't need to. #thisismytrophy  #okavangolions  #bigcats  #dubaplains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The images is in black & white because I made it with an infra-red sensitive camera and infra-red flashes (which are invisible to us and other mammals), so as to minimize disturbance to wildlife.

       "192  Photo by @joelsartore | Measuring up to three feet in length and weighing nearly 200 pounds, the Yangtze giant softshell turtle is the world’s largest freshwater turtle. With only four known to exist in the world, it is also incredibly rare. This male, thought to be over 100-years-old, calls the Suzhou Zoo in China home, along with one other female. This species must breed soon or it will go extinct. Past attempts to breed the pair at the Suzhou Zoo have proved difficult, with three unsuccessful artificial insemination attempts. However, researchers were recently delighted to find two of these turtles swimming freely in Vietnam. @turtlesurvival is coordinating efforts with WCS Vietnam, the Asian Turtle Program and others to hopefully capture and breed the pair.

This is what the #greenhouses  actually looked like when I flew my drone over Koppert Cress in The Netherlands, who grow micro-greens for gourmet chefs throughout Europe and the Middle East. They use magenta frequency LEDs to extend their growing season and assure product uniformity. Plants don’t absorb green light, so magenta LEDs are more power efficient.

       "197  Photo by @chamiltonjames words by @chrisfagan_uac | Jorge is chief of the Chitonahua tribe, one of several indigenous tribes in Peru considered in initial contact with the outside world. His eye was shot out by a logger when Jorge and his dad tried to raid a logging camp for machetes and other items in the mid 1990’s. They escaped, but soon after were hunted down by the loggers aided by guides from another indigenous tribe. Approximately 15 Chitonahua were captured and forced to leave the forest interior and relocate to a village on the Yurua River where they live today. Despite being contacted over 20 years ago, the Chitonahua still struggle to assimilate into modern society. This includes earning money to purchase salt, medicine, clothing and other items they now depend on. However, compared to many other tribes in initial contact in Peru, the Chitonahua are doing relatively well. They have an impressive garden of vegetables, fruit trees and medicinal plants and recently won a government sponsored competition among local villages for raising domesticated animals. Perhaps most importantly, the children attend school nearby and speak fluent Spanish. Shot for the Peru part of our October issue on the Amazon’s isolated tribes.

       "198  Photo by @renaeffendiphoto | Vasile has been a shepherd since the age of nine. He has never been able to afford his own flock, and is constantly on the move—a reason, he says, that women have always left him. In Transylvania and other remote areas of Romania, many people farm on a small scale, in ways unchanged for centuries. Their farms have among the lowest yields in Europe, but also some of the highest levels of self-sufficiency. Lack of money and suspicion of unfamiliar methods mean that few chemicals and artificial fertilizers are used. But in the past decade, many have abandoned their farms for at least part of the year to work in cities abroad. Romania’s 2007 entry into the European Union also threatened this traditional way of life, as farmers cannot compete with European imports, and the small size of farms means they are not eligible for EU subsidies.

Then in 2015 the journey became even more perilous. “The army started hunting us,” says Adji, who at 32 had been ferrying migrants to Libya for nearly 15 years. “They are even shooting at our trucks.” I photographed the EU-funded crackdown on Niger’s smuggling industry as part of a special investigation led by @tymccormick5 and published in @foreignpolicymag last year. This series ‘My Smuggler, My Savior’ explores the complicated role these men play in the lives of those attempting the journey to Europe. They’re migrants’ only chance of making it safely across the Sahara. They’re also outlaws engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Niger’s military. Adji’s truck was hijacked by bandits in 2016 as he traveled along a new and more dangerous route to Libya. He barely survived, walking for miles in the desert before stumbling across another migrant caravan. For the sake of his wife and children, Adji says he has left the trade, but those who are still willing to make the trip can expect profits even bigger than before. #migration  #europe  #niger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "200  Photo by @ronan_donovan | A storm builds over Church Rock in New Mexico's Red Rock State Park. My church has always been a place without walls. Raised in rural Vermont, my parents never forced a man-made theology upon my brother and I. Instead, they allowed us to experience the physical world that wasn’t created by man. The thunder, the cold winters, the spotted salamanders, the spring peepers, the night sky, the goldfinches, ravens, evening grosbeaks, ruby-throated hummingbirds, the taste of wild blackberries, summer squash from the garden, and countless other life experiences that cannot be had indoors. If I worship any one thing, it would be the sun for it brings life to all things on Earth. I feel its warmth on my face, I long for its return in winter, I know its wrath when I expose my skin too it’s rays for too long, and I see the life it brings all over the world with my own eyes. I believe in what I see and what feels real to me. I worship healthy ecosystems because they bring life to us all.

These structures, built by the Ancestral Pueblo people (often, and inappropriately, called the Anasazi), most likely date between 700-1250CE. By 700 there was a strong dependence on corn as a food source in the Cedar Mesa area as well as beans and squash. To survive long droughts these foods would have been stored in massive quantities to last several years in these cliffside granaries.

       "203  Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio | Territorially part of Yemen, Socotra (Arabic: سُقُطْرَى Suquṭra), is an archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as \"\"the most alien-looking place on Earth”. In the Dragon's Blood tree Forest at Diksam. An hour long exposure. The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an \"\"upturned, densely packed crown\"\". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as \"\"dragon's blood\"\". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock. One of the species' greatest threats is the gradual dessication of the archipelago.

These are some of the new challenges this hopeful currently nation face. #internallydisplaced  #Colombia  #postconflictchallenges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

So striking in contrast to monochrome grasslands. These lakes, often salt water, have a mineral content that gives them the green glow. People believe the lakes have spirits and therefore are worshiped by doing kora. The water is not used for anything - not fishing, bathing, boating or washing.

       "206  Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Lions are roaring in Liwonde National Park in Malawi after decades of being extinct thanks to the work of @AfricanParksNetwork , the Malawian Government, @LionRecovery , @leonardodicapriofdn and @leonardodicaprio Liwonde National Park was recently on the verge of collapse just 3 years ago -the park was overrun with poaching and more wire snares existed in the park than large animals. But in 2015, @AfricanParksNetwork assumed management of the park on behalf of the Government, and immediately got to work training and outfitting their Ranger unit, preventing poaching, removing almost 30,000 snares, and making the park safe for nature's return. In 2017 they reintroduced cheetahs, and just as of August 16th, they reintroduced lions to restore this iconic species to the park, and help balance natural systems by bringing back critically needed predators. This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

       "207  Photo by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto | From the project FIRST JOB - One’s first job is rarely forgotten. It is the beginning of adulthood, a rite of passage and a turning point. For numerous workers, only 30 years ago, the first job was often the only one, as people could remained in the same company for a lifetime, just being gradually promoted or slightly changing ones positions with seniority. In today’s scenario all is temporary, as the dream of a life position has forever vanished. Usually the first job is the first of a long list that will follow. In the wake of the worst economic crises in modern history, where for many young adults there seemed to be actually no possibility for a first job at all, I explore the world of employment of today’s youth. This is a project that will be carried out in all the 5 continents where the global theme does not obscure, but actually heightens the local specificities. Each one of the subjects whose portrait has been taken has an individual story that feeds into a larger narrative on how the world we live in is changing. From China to France, from Brazil to the U.S. we get a personal introduction to tomorrow’s workforce /// Jimei, China - Chen Ming Ya, 22, was born and raised in Xiamen, China. She studied to become a hotel manager, but her real dream is to become a member of the Communist Party and work for the government. She loves politics, and says they are her greatest passion. Three months ago, right after she finished school, she started working as a receptionist in a sort of hotel owned by the state, which accepts only government people as guests. She works 8 hours a day, and she can have 2 days off per week. She earns RMB 3,200, or around USD 500, per month. /// Follow me @gabrielegalimbertiphoto for more stories - #firstjob  #job  #work  #china  #jimei  #hotel  #communistparty  #workforce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

A few weeks after this photo was taken, Alex made history by making the first free solo of El Capitan - climbed it without ropes. Heralded by some as one of the greatest athletic feats of all time. The stakes could be no higher…perfection or death. Directed by @mochinyc and @jimmy_chin, the film was shot over two years while following Alex during his meticulous preparation and final climb. Much more than a climbing film, Free Solo is about life, love, dreaming big and facing your fears. @FreeSoloFilm has opened in theaters to rave reviews and leads the nominations for the third annual Critics' Choice Documentary Awards.

The question: Whose land is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "211  Photo by @chamiltonjames. Text by @chrisfagan_uac | Worn footpaths and a clean garden of manioc and papaya hint at the recent use of this village by an isolated tribe near Peru’s remote Alto Purús National Park. This border area between Peru and Brazil is home to perhaps the largest number of people living in isolation on earth. But despite its remoteness their lives are being threatened. A different tribe recently contacted nearby, told of a horrific massacre by men with automatic weapons; most likely narcos who use the area to move coca to Brazil. This photo was taken at a safe distance and only after we were certain nobody was at home. The tribe who live in the village are semi-nomadic and known to leave for weeks at a time to collect turtle eggs and other resources closer to major rivers.

       "212  Photo by @beverlyjoubert | It’s a tough time of year in Botswana before the summer rains begin. Food is more limited - especially green, fresh, nutrient-filled vegetation. Elephants are lucky enough to have a very varied diet and spend the winter months eating more bark and woody vegetation. After a long winter, the reduced levels of nutrients can begin to take a toll on their condition - particularly in younger animals. The elephants will soon feast on green grass when the rains come, but right now they’re actively digging for rhizomes and bulbs to supplement their woody meals.

However, they must always have their guard up; if they get too comfortable in the unpredictable waters of the ocean, they may end up as a meal. #FollowMe  at @PaulNicklen for more photos of penguins. #penguin  #gentoo  #nature  #photography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "215  Photo by @FransLanting | The other night I had the great honor of receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from @nhm_wpy, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition during a ceremony in London’s magnificent Natural History Museum. I was given a wonderful sculpture of a bull elephant. When my partner in life and work @ChristineEckstrom examined it closely, she realized it had been modeled after a photo I had made on assignment for @natgeo years ago of a famous elephant named \"\"Survivor\"\" in Zambia’s North Luangwa Valley. Survivor lived through a previous poaching holocaust in the 1980s and he was written up in Mark and Delia Owens' books \"\"Eye of the Elephant\"\" and \"\"Survivor’s Song.\"\" The bull elephants depicted here, which I photographed in Botswana one memorable evening, lived more tranquil lives thanks to its government’s enlightened policy of putting a moratorium on elephant hunting, but even there the tide is turning. Nearly one hundred elephants were found poached in an area recently that had been a safe haven for years. I’m sharing this image in honor of all elephant champions including the late Paul Allen, and respectfully ask that you consider supporting the organizations that can turn the current poaching crisis around and secure a future for elephants.

       "216  Photo by @TimLaman | Male Red Bird-of-Paradise high in the canopy of Waigeo Island, poses on his display perch with the ocean in the background. Indonesia’s provinces of Papua and West Papua on island of New Guinea make up the Land of Papua or \"Tanah Papua\" in the Indonesian language. This region supports one of the only remaining large tropical forests in the world and is home to nearly half of Indonesia’s biodiversity. Over 600 species of birds are found in Papua, including 27 bird-of-paradise species, many of which live nowhere else on earth. At a major international Conference in Manokwari on Oct 10, the provinces made a major commitment to a green future. West Papua has declared itself a “Conservation Province” and both provinces have tremendous environmental leadership, and committed to preserving 70% of their land as forest.

       "220  Photo by @Hammond_Robin for @ICRC | In northeastern Nigeria, merely going to work can be an act of bravery. 29 year old nurse Nafisa Abdulhameed (pictured) who works in an ICRC supported hospital learnt yesterday just how risky her work is. It has been announced that her colleague, 24-year-old Hauwa Mohammed Liman, a health worker, who had been abducted in March was killed by her captors. Another health worker abducted at the same time, Saifura Hussaini Ahmed Khorsa was killed in September. A third is still held captive. The ICRC made sustained and committed efforts to secure the release of the health-care workers, including a last-minute plea for mercy on Sunday to the Islamic State West Africa Province group, to no avail. // Nafisa is familiar with the violence that has rocked the region. She works in a specialist gunshot and bomb blast wounded ward set up and run by the ICRC in the State Specialist Hospital in Maiduguri. Everyday she stitches wounds and plugs gaping wounds of men and women who’ve experienced first hand the destructive force of sharp exploding metal. // Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. While living with and reacting to those consequences, women are hardly passive victims, though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. // This work was supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organization working on all sides of conflict to alleviate people’s suffering.

       "221  Photo by @joelsartore | Currently, only three institutions in the world are home to the critically endangered rufous-fronted laughingthrush. The main population is housed at Cikananga Conservation Breeding Center (CCBC) @cikananga.foundation in Java where a captive breeding program was implemented in 2013. Over the past 5 years the facility has bred a total of 18 birds, with 17 still residing at CCBC. The key to success for this species will come from getting birds from different captive populations to breed with one another. The more genetic diversity a population has, the healthier it is, and the greater its chance of survival. With a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck this species may one day return to the wild. @zootrhy_plzen where this bird was photographed houses and breeds and has one of the finest collections of this species in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "222  Photo by @williamalbertallard | India, 2002. I got to work in India for the first time in what was kind of the twilight of my career that dates back to 1964. I was assigned by @natgeo to photograph the Dalits, also known as the Untouchables, those people who exist on the lowest rung of the India caste system. This man has just emerged from cleaning out a sewer filled with filth by using only a bucket and a rope. After finishing and closing the concrete cover, he had to go to several nearby homes before gaining permission to wash himself off with a garden hose. Because he is an Untouchable he is destined to do what his father, his grandfather, and all the men in his family's past did, to clean waste from sewers. There are Untouchables generations destined to a tradition of washing clothes, or tanning leather hides, or other tasks members of the upper castes refuse to do. Despite his situation, this man who sits covered in sewage, wears a thin gold chain around his neck and I was struck by how it seemed to match the glint of pride in his eyes as I made his portrait. He may be a collector of other people's wastes, but he does so with self esteem. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of India and other @natgeo assignments spanning five-decades. @thephotosociety #india  #Dalit  #castes  #onassignment  #untouchable \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "225  Photo by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto | I’m recently turned 40 and almost every friend around me has become a parent over the last few years. A couple of friends and I are the only ones in our group who still don’t have kids of our own. I naturally began to observe how the others were raising their children. I watch them playing together, hear the arguments and the kids’ complaints at mealtimes or at bedtime. I’ve often been the one in charge of the kids when those moments happen. Just maybe, all of these things are making me start to want to be a father. That is why I’ve decided to make the relationships between fathers and their children the focus of this photo project. Wherever I am in the world, when I meet a father I ask him to tell me about a special moment he has spent with his children and, when I can, I photograph them together /// From the about FATHERS - Breda, The Netherlands – Raoul (43), Tijn (6) and Ole (4) - Raoul is from Portugal originally, but he has been living in Holland for many years. He’s a successful entrepreneur and owns a consulting company that operates in the oil and gas sector. He lives in Breda with his wife and children. He commutes to Rotterdam for work every day, by train or by car. “It’s a little stressful, but I’d rather live in a small city than in Rotterdam.” He travels to the Middle East, too, about 5 or 6 times a year. Raoul doesn’t have much free time to be with his family. He’s mostly only able to spend time with them on weekends, which he loves spending with his children. Lately, their favorite pastime has been bicycling. “Ole, the youngest, is just now learning to ride by himself, so I still have to help him all the time and be careful that he doesn't fall.” /// Follow me for more stories @gabrielegalimbertiphoto #father  #fathers  #dad  #dads  #netherlands  #bike  #biking  #breda  #rotterdam  #holland  #fatherhood                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "226  Photo by @beverlyjoubert | The dominant male from the Tsaro Pride at Duba Plains is well used to crossing deep channels on a daily basis. This one is only chest-deep and a path has been forged by a hippo.There's no keeping your paws dry in the Okavango when the dominant prey species is happy to wallow or feed where the area is at its swampiest. Right now he's not hunting; he's leaving that to the females who are after red lechwe, but he's following behind them so as not to miss out when they are successful. It's not unusual for the females to make a kill specifically for the male and then move away to a different area while he is busy eating, in order to hunt for the rest of the pride. #Okavangolions  #DubaPlains  #Tsaropride  #Thisismytrophy  #wetcat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "230  Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio | I was fortunate to travel to Socotra not just once, but twice. Here another two images of the astonishing white sand beach at Detwah Lagoon near Qalansia (or Qalansiyah). Socotra (Arabic: سُقُطْرَى Suquṭra), is an archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea and territorially part of Yemen. The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 240km (150mi) east of the Horn of Africa. It has been described as \"\"the most alien-looking place on Earth”. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life isn't found anywhere else on Earth. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 endemic species; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more.

       "236  Video by @TimLaman & @RussLaman | A spectacular misty morning flight over the rain forest of Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, one of the best remaining lowland rainforest sites in all of Borneo, and a refuge of Indonesia’s amazing biodiversity. Filmed back in July after a rainy night created the perfect misty conditions at dawn. I’m excited to be going back to Gunung Palung this week to follow up on my @NatGeo camera trapping project and see if we’ve gotten any unusual critters. Stay tuned in by following @TimLaman and I’ll be sharing some of the lesser-known rain forest animals of Borneo. #GunungPalung , #Kalimantan , #rainforest , #mist , #Borneo , #IndonesiaBiodiversity .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "237  Wild_Life with @bertiegregory // The amount of effort that macaroni penguins must put in to give their chicks just a chance at survival is hard to comprehend. Giant waves, razor sharp rocks, mountain climbs and hungry seals are just a handful of the challenges these penguins must overcome each day to get just a single meal to their chick. // Check out the new season of Wild_Life at natgeo.com/wildlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "238  Photo by @davidalanharvey | The surfing scene in the Outer Banks NC is super eclectic, with a few super surf stars and a lot of riders like Alejandra @ale_jandram who are simply learning to read the waves. Here the Atlantic has a sandy bottom and the best surf breaks move around just like the islands themselves, as opposed to solid reef breaks in other parts of the world. This means less world class surf, yet more break spots for everyone. This makes for a generally polite, everybody gets a wave crowd. Fall is just around the corner and that’s when we do get the rare yet sweet double overhead barrels. Wind and sea.

       "242  Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | In Ittoqqortoormiit we sat down to discuss options for sailing on with the boat. We had maps of Wegener Halvø peninsula, up-to-date satellite images showing the sea-ice extent and nautical charts with limited soundings. The satellite images showed that accessing the fjords around the peninsula was impossible because of the sea ice. In addition the nautical charts showed that there was limited information, meaning the true nature of the depth and terrain of the fjord was still rather a mystery. Onward travel to Wegener Halvø peninsula by boat seemed highly unlikely at this point. We had to look at other options... @greenland_caves #EAGRE18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "243  Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | We arrived in the colourful village of Ittoqqortoormiit in East Greenland late on the evening of the 3rd August and spent five days there as we waited for a good weather/sea ice opportunity to continue further north. During the ‘night’ of our second evening we were all woken up by a loud fog horn. It was from the supply tanker that comes in only twice a year. This was the first time it had arrived this year; the last time being at the end of September last year. The village came alive as for two days the residents were busy with the containers that were being ferried back and forth between the ship and land. @greenland_caves #EAGRE18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

She feels it would be unsafe for her to be open about her gender identity: “When I'm outside the house I have to pretend I'm the boss. I need to walk more masculine, not very feminine, like the way I feel when I'm in the house. And the way I talk too sometimes when I'm out, I have to be very careful because when you start talking and you start being all fabulous and all gay, they'll raise eyebrows. So when I'm out there and I'm talking I need to talk straight. I need to act straight.” // Where Love is Illegal traveled to Kenya, Mozambique and Ghana with the support of Elton John AIDS Foundation (@ejaf) to continue our work sharing LGBTQI+ stories of survival and to raise awareness of the impacts of stigma.

       "245  Photo by Stephen Alvarez @salvarezphoto | A long extinct Steppe Bison painted on the ceiling of Altamira Cave, Spain. The cave of Altamira was reported in 1880 by Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. It was the first paleolithic art cave to be identified. The cave was first greeted with amazement but the discovery soon deteriorated into deep controversy that followed Marcelino Sanz de Salutoula to his grave. In the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. Paintings like this could not have possibly been made by Ice Age people. It was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in France that Altamira was accepted as genuine. Archaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the Upper Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 BCE). Uranium/Thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the Aurignacian and Solutrean periods (36,000-22,000 BCE). This U-T dating suggests that Altamira was painted over a period of more than 10,000 years.

       "246  Photo by @laurentballesta | The first time was in 2010. I will never forget this under water canyon and the pleasure of this « negative ascent » at -120m (360ft)… although it lasted less than 3 minutes. We had to be quick, first not to drift, but also because I simply like it: the pressure does not crush me, it embraces me. But how could one believe that this planet is only 3 minutes from ours. You’d like to know where it’s located ? I let you guess. A clue : I went there thanks to Peter Timm, now gone, for a face to face with a living legend, a mythical fish, locally named Gombessa. Did you guess ?!… The answer on @laurentballesta. La première fois, c’était en 2010. Je n’oublierai jamais ce canyon sous-marin et le plaisir de cette « ascension négative » à -120 m de fond… Pourtant, elle a duré moins de 3 minutes. Il faut faire vite, d’abord pour ne pas dériver, mais aussi parce que j’aime ça tout simplement : la pression ne m’écrase pas, elle m’enlace. C’est difficile de croire que cette autre planète n’est qu’à 3 minutes de la nôtre. Vous voulez savoir où elle se trouve ? Je vous laisse deviner.

       "247  Photo by @Joelsartore | Meet the tanuki, also known as a raccoon dog. This species is usually brown and black, however, this tanuki who lives at @okczoo is leucistic, meaning it lacks color. In the mid-20th century, the fur-farming industry introduced a few thousand raccoon dogs to European parts of the Soviet Union and they have since thrived in northern and eastern Europe. Although their population is stable, they are still hunted for their fur in some areas. In Japan, numerous myths and legends surround the tanuki; folklore holds that the species are tricksters and shapeshifters, but not malicious. #photoark  #tanuki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Replacing natural teeth with gold implants or caps was once a status symbol in Uzbekistan and other countries of Central Asia. For generations people went to goldsmiths to replace their teeth with gold in case of decay or other problems, but sometimes healthy teeth were pulled out and replaced with gold for prestige. However, the younger generation no longer follows this tradition.

       "250  Photo by @paolowoods | A dragon's blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) at sunset near Fermin in the mountains of Socotra. The dragon’s blood tree is a strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree that is only found in Socotra. Its red sap was the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a medicine and a dye. Socotra is a small island in the Indian Ocean that is part of Yemen. It is far from the main land (about 350 Km) and that has contributed to its historic and biological isolation over the years resulting in an amazing endemic fauna and flora. Surveys have revealed that more than a third of the 800 or so plant species of Socotra are found nowhere else. It has been till recently a Yemeni military base, were access was very restricted, and this has contributed to preserve it from any kind of mass tourism. But the immense beauty of the mountainous landscape, the stunning variety of the underwater life, the pristine beaches and uniqueness of its flora are making it a sought-after ecotourism destination. #socotra  #tree  #yemen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "251  Photo by @CarltonWard | The corner of the northern Gulf of Mexico where Hurricane Michael made landfall is known as the Forgotten Coast. My prayers are with the people, many of whom lost their homes and businesses to tornado strength winds and tremendous storm surge. I’m thinking about towns like Apalachicola, where 80 percent of households depend upon Gulf fisheries for their livelihoods, and remembering my time there during the last Florida Wildlife Corridor Expedition. In this photo, third generation Apalachicola Kendall oysterman Schoelles tongs for oysters in St Vincent Sound where one million acres of contiguous protected land extend north from the coast, providing crucial wildlife habitat while helping ensure the health of the estuary downstream. Oysters filter the bay to clean the water. In that way, Kendall and oyster men and women like him are protecting the Gulf for all of us, especially as they plant new oyster beds that also help buffer the coast against storms. I trust Kendall has weathered this hurricane. He and his family have weathered storms on the Gulf for more than a century. Hopefully he will be tonging for oysters and caring for the bay again soon. Maybe there will be a silver lining and the hurricane will have dissipated the red tide that has been plaguing the Gulf this summer, arguably exacerbated by pollution from millions of coastal residence who don't live in balance with the ecosystem the way Kendall does. But the Gulf is resilient and balance and sustainability are possible if we all pay attention and do our part. Long live the Forgotten Coast. #GulfofMexico  #ForgottenCoast  #FloridaWild  @FL_WildCorridor @Nature_org #KeepFLWild  @SeaLegacy #TurntheTide  @natgeoimagecollection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "252  Photo by @vincentjmusi | Zorro, 2018. Many people envision working in the studio as a high-energy, creative experience with me shouting “beautiful baby, beautiful” and the dogs responding with pose after pose like models before the lens of the famous fashion photographer and international spy, Austin Powers. The reality is, I’m somewhat unable to speak when making photographs. It’s a genetic flaw or some right brain/left brain quirk realized when I was rejected from my childhood garage band for not being able to sing and play drums at the same time. Damn you Phil Collins. When we work, this leaves me with a limited menu of grunting noises and the occasional guttural outburst, which I still find helpful in getting an animals attention. It also passes for a kind of barbaric shorthand between my wife Callie and I, until she tires of it and gets mad at me, which she finds helpful in getting my attention. Zorro is a 12 year-old Standard Poodle, too smart to get in the middle of our bickering. He tried to stay neutral but always sided with Callie. This is often the case with the nice lady holding food and I learn to live with rejection. This is more frustrating because Zorro is a very special dog that lights up a room when he enters and I want a dog like that to like me. More caregiver than therapy dog, Zorro has always been there for the people who needed him most, some at the end of their lives and some who would miss those people the most. Our connection was fleeting and dramatic and came together when I was finally able to vocalize a sound that engaged Zorro. I was trying to say his name but it came out with a poor rationing of consonants to vowels; Shtwa -thwo-or-oht-za-moAlshs This stopped Zorro, deeply engaged with Callie and a snack of some kind, He turned to me, tilted his head and then he gave me -The Eyes; the eyes that had comforted, the eyes that had gotten him out of trouble, the eyes that had earned him more than his fair share of mac and cheese. And then, Zorro burped. Beautiful baby, beautiful. You can find more dispatches from #TheYearOfTheDogs , a personal project by @vincentjmusi           \n",

       "254  Photo by @williamalbertallard | Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, 1964. This gently portrait of an Amish boy holding his pet guinea pig started my career as a professional photographer and my 50 years as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine. In the spring of 1964, I was blessed with getting a photographic internship at National Geographic in Washington D.C. after showing my portfolio of work to Robert E. Gilka, the legendary director of photography at National Geographic. As my first assignment as an intern, Gilka sent me to Lancaster County, PA to cover a Pennsylvania Dutch festival. \"\"Try to get some pictures of the Amish, if you can,\"\" he told me. It seemed the magazine had a finished manuscript about the Amish but had no pictures. He didn't tell he'd earlier sent a staff photographer to Pennsylvania who'd come back with nothing. Although I photographed the festival events my success with the Amish came through driving the country roads, introducing myself to Amish farmers, many of whom turned me down but eventually finding one who allowed me to photograph his family and their way of life. My first assignment which was to have been for a weekend or perhaps a week, lasted through much of the summer and into the fall of 1964. On an overcast afternoon, after photographing an Amish farmer working in his fields I was brought to the barn by his son so he could show me his pet guinea pig. My portrait of the boy and his pet became the lead picture in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster county published in the August, 1965 issue, a story which has been credited as the beginning of a new, more intimate look at people in the National Geographic Magazine. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of the Amish and other assignments spanning a five-decade career. @thephotosociety #amish  #farm  #onassignment  #filmphotography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "255  Video by @bertiegregory | Meet the macaroni penguin. These special little penguins have some serious attitude. They are horrible to almost everything (the two exceptions being their mate and their chick). Surprisingly, they don't get their macaroni name from cheesy pasta. Instead, they were named because their yellow crest feathers reminded explorers of fashionable hats worn by 18th century men called 'macaronis'.

       "256  Photos by @Hammond_Robin for @ICRC | “My hope is to be able to finish school so I can help mum and my siblings,” says 15-year-old Jaliyah from the evacuation centre that is now her home. Her infectious smile betrays the trauma from the war she has fled in her hometown of Marawi in the Philippines. Her apparent cheerfulness cuts through the misery of her surroundings and hides the fear she has for the sister, not seen since they were displaced, and the father who was arrested as a suspected member of the opposition armed group. What does she want for her future? “The best thing that could happen here in the evacuation centre would be meeting new friends and meeting long lost relatives.” #dayofthegirl . // For nearly five decades, the Philippine government has been engaged in armed conflicts in the southern region of Mindanao with several armed groups. The prolonged conflicts, rooted deeply in disputes over land, political and religious ideology, resulted in thousands of people being killed, with many more enduring repeated displacement and hardship. // Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. While living with and reacting to those consequences, women are hardly passive victims, though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. // The International Committee of the Red Cross is a humanitarian organization working on all sides of conflict to alleviate people’s suffering.

       "259  Photo by @davidalanharvey | Many years ago I stayed for a couple of weeks here at the Sea Foam motel. I wasn’t on vacation, but shooting my first, but not last, story on the Outer Banks for @NatGeo. The place intrigues me. Partly a nostalgia trip for the 50’s pull your car up to the front door to your motel days. It’s also been on my mind for years as a photo story. I’ve shot it many times in all kinds of light thinking to have it as my book cover/title on the upcoming outer banks book. There are many fancier places one can stay here, yet none more retro and perfectly placed on the ocean front. If you get down to the OBX at least drive by and check it out. You too will see a movie set waiting to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "260  Photo by @williamalbertallard | Lancaster County, PA, 1964. The portrait of the fragile but seemingly unafraid little girl seen alongside the heads of two enormous draft horses was published in the August, 1964 issue of National Geographic in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The child was with her father who was working in his fields. At some point in the afternoon she was standing in the back of a farm wagon, the horses, unhitched, were about to be led to the barn and for a moment they provided the background for her profile. Her blouse appears worn, perhaps a bit dirty from childish play, and its pale blue color seems to echo the softness in the child's light complexion and wispy, blond hair. Photographing the Amish was the beginning of my photographic depiction of several subcultures in my country and elsewhere during the 1960's. My essays on the Amish in 1964, the Basques of France and Spain in 1968, and the Hutterites of Montana in 1969, all dealt with the lives of people living in a culture of their own. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of the Amish and other assignments spanning five-decades. @thephotosociety #amish  #farm  #child  #horses  #onassignment  #filmphotography                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Because of her small stature, Baby needed a cesarean section to safely give birth to their son, Joseph. This image was made #onassignment  for @natgeo for a story called The Dangerous Lives of Girls. While child marriage is a critical issue in both crisis and stable contexts, the rates of girls married underage is rising at alarming rates in humanitarian settings according to @GirlsNotBrides. Today is the 7th annual International Day of the Girl Child. Poverty, violence, and cultural traditions oppress millions of girls in every part of the world. It is still a global struggle to have girls valued for more than their bodies — for just their sexuality, fertility and labor. Today we come together to help galvanize support and inspire the international community to do its part to establish, expand and protect girls’ rights so girls are free to determine the course of their own lives. It’s also a time to celebrate girls in every way, which is long overdue. #IDG2018  #dayofthegirl  #tooyoungtowed  #endchildmarriage  #girls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "262  Photo by @maggiesteber | This is Philomene, a young girl I photographed in the dry northwest town of Beauchamp, Haiti many years ago. I’m posting her photograph to remember her and other young Haitian girls today on the International #DayoftheGirl . She was a student in a small local school. She told me she loved to read and that one day she hoped to be a nurse. I never saw her again after that visit but I think of her quite often because she so embodied the spirit and talent and the hopes and sense of possibility that all Haitians share and that is shared by young girls around the world. I hope she accomplished her dreams. Like many developing nations, the literacy rate in Haiti is low and below the average for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Haiti faces shortages in educational supplies and qualified teachers where the rural population is less educated than the urban. A major earthquake in 2010 exacerbated an already difficult system by destroying infrastructure and displacing 50 to 90% of of students. Private education, which must be paid for, has substituted for education in public schools although the government has attempted initiatives to change this. I tried very hard to help educate children in Haiti but the need was like a bottomless pit. In the world young women 15-29 are more than 3 times as likely as young men to not be in employment, education or training, according to UNICEF. Education can help change stereotypes we have held onto too long and take advantage of the talent and creative voices of girls to make a more vibrant and equitable world. There are many organisations, ranging from public to private, that support and promote the education of girls around the world. If you want to make the world a better place and safer for young women, please consider researching and supporting the education of girls and give them a voice. #dayofthegirl  #tooyoungtowed  #unicef  #educategirls  #haiti  #education                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Da Silva is nearsighted, which means it is difficult for her to read or see anything at a distance. Currently more than a billion people worldwide need glasses, but have no way to get them. Taking their commitment to bring sight to the world, OneSight, an independent nonprofit, hosted their first-ever, fully digital, eye clinic in the Amazon. More than 2,000 patients traveled to the clinic during a five-day boat expedition to bring better vision to a remote and underserved area. Lack of access to good vision care is no small issue. It can create a cascading series of problems for individuals, families, and communities - starting in school, when students can’t see what’s going on and have trouble reading. Uncorrected vision can have an impact on a persons employment prospects and even lead to social isolation. // Over a billion people across the world need glasses, but have no way to get them. In parts of the Amazon, people have to travel over 24 hours by boat to receive vision care. @OneSight found a way to reach them and provide more than clear sight.

       "264  Wild_Life with @bertiegregory // In an incredible rare predatory event, an Antarctic fur seal hunts macaroni penguins on land on the Island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. This was hard to watch but I felt it was an important part of the macaroni penguins’ life story. Giant waves, razor sharp rocks, mountain climbs and these seals (usually hunting the penguin in the water) are just a handful of the challenges these penguins must overcome on a daily basis. Only the toughest individuals survive to pass on their genes to the next generation. Brutal as this encounter was, there was an unexpected twist, watch this week’s episode of Wild_Life: Resurrection Island to find out what happened. // Check out the new season of Wild_Life at natgeo.com/wildlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "265  Photo by Daniella Zalcman @dzalcman | On Monday, the Cleveland Indians lost to the Houston Astros — signaling the end of the team's controversial logo, Chief Wahoo. Starting next year, the Indians will remove his likeness from player uniforms and elsewhere in Progressive Field, though they will continue to sell Wahoo merchandise and memorabilia in their stores. This fan — watching a game against the Chicago Cubs back in April — is wearing a vintage jacket with a version of the Wahoo logo from the 1940s. The current iteration is just as much of a racist caricature: complete with tomato-red skin, an exaggerated hooked nose, and cartoonish grin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

De Poezenboot, which is Dutch for “the Catboat” hosts around 50 stray and abandoned cats, 17 of which are permanent residents that have lived on the boat for several years. Day after day, you become part of their environment, you are just another big cat for them.

       "267  Photo by @TimLaman | A wild female orangutan in Borneo crosses a fallen tree making a natural bridge over a river. This is a new camera trap shot I just got on my recent visit to Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. I was there checking on my ongoing @NatGeo project to try to document the less well known nocturnal mammals. But in this case, I captured an orangutan female instead, actually carrying a baby on her belly (that is hard to see except its orange fur) who was being chased by bees and came down to the ground. If you look closely, you can see many bees around her. Orangutans like to raid bee hives and eat the honey, but when they get swarmed by the bees, they often drop to the ground to try to make an escape and this female just happened to cross this log over the river where my remote camera was set up.
