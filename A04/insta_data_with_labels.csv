Like many rivers in the Great Lakes region, the water quality of the Cuyahoga is much improved but the sediments, vegetation and aquatic life are still impaired.",495,143072,

The sadness amongst us was such that one could feel it in the air. The hardest part wasn’t that they died but how they died. In one hour of searching a football field-sized clearing, @harry__turner, @melissalesh, and I found 4 dead snakes, 4 dead yellow footed tortoises, dozens of lizards and rodents, and hundreds of insects. The loss of rainforest alone gives all of us, including me, good reason to think more carefully about the sources of the things we buy. But knowing so many animals meet their end like this has renewed my vigilance to be a more careful consumer.

This male jag is looking for caiman for her dinner—while a female waits on the bank. Shot in August in the Pantanal of Brazil. Our animal family is so much like us: They find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel, and have emotions, we will all be better humans. We need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not. Jaguars are the third largest of the big cats. They are found from the U.S./Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in Brazil's Patanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguar's range. Poaching for skins, bones, and teeth is also growing for the first time since the 1970s to feed the demand of people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth,” Chinese traditional medicine, and now luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid My first story with big cats was the first @natgeo jaguar story 20 years ago!

We humans hunted the whales and seals to near extinction and introduced an army of egg eating rats that ran riot through the ground nesting bird colonies. Whilst South Georgia is a document of the worse of human nature, it is also a document of the best.

The reversal allows for these products to be used in medical research or healing, uses long since proven to have no benefits to humans. This change will certainly lead to more pressure on already terribly vulnerable animal populations and place in greater danger the conservationists, rangers and communities who fight for the survival of these majestic creatures. Here, Sudan, the last living male Northern White Rhino left on this planet is comforted moments before he passed away March 19, 2018 in northern Kenya. Sudan was brought to Kenya from @safari_park_dvur_kralove in the #Czechrepublic  in 2009. He died surrounded by people who loved him at @olpejeta and has been an inspirational figure for many across the world. If there is any meaning in his death, its that Sudan can be our final wake up call. In a world of 7 billion, we need to start recognizing that we are not separate from nature. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then saving nature is really about saving ourselves. Today, fewer 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild. We are witnessing extinction on our watch and must help them by speaking out and supporting conservation efforts worldwide, especially among the indigenous communities who are on the front lines every day against poaching.

Many photographers have personal projects and it is these in which instead of telling the stories of others, we tell our own stories in whatever form we please. This is what the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma is for me. In my career I have covered everything from war to fashion and seen great suffering and violence. I have told stories about heroic figures and those who were beaten down by life. We photographers choose to be in places where we see suffering and glory and to bear witness. But these things impact us in unexpected ways including a kind of longing for normality or loneliness or missing home or feeling completely disconnected from the world. We don’t realize the toll it takes on us until we are forced to face it. In the past two years alongside regular assignments, sometimes challenging ones, I decided I needed to play, to plant the seeds of new ideas, to be wild at heart without having to make excuses or explain myself, to tell my own story or a part of it. I created The Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma. Lily is my alter ego in an alternate universe. She is everything I am not….or maybe she is everything I am.

Ponce de Leon brought them on sailing ships from Spain during his second voyage to the New World. Although he was attacked by Calusa Indians (and later died of his wounds in Havana), cattle and horses remained. When my ancestors migrated into Florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the Florida woods for nearly three centuries. Descendants of these original Spanish livestock are called """"cracker"""" cattle and horses today. Early American settlers of the Florida frontier were also called """"crackers"""", attributed to the """"crack"""" of their cow whips. Modern horses actually evolved in North America but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. Much of the southeastern US was adapted to grazers. There were herds of wild bison in Florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). There are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the Northern Everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems. Cattle grazing in this region has been shown by @ArchboldStation to increase net carbon sequestration by grasslands.

Mr. Sam has spent the past 30 years working to help identify and repatriate the remains of children who died while at boarding schools across the country. He came to Carlisle in early October for a gathering hosted by the Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which brought together Native boarding school survivors, activists, and many community leaders who, like Mr. Sam, are working to bring the children buried at Carlisle back to their homelands. #carlisle  #indianboardingschool  @nabshc",915,198134,"['tree', 'plant', 'grass', 'real estate', 'arecales', 'outdoor structure', 'plantation', 'shrub', 'evergreen', 'landscape']"

What at first was a slightly nervous moment as this warrior simply came and sat next to me, has over the years developed into a deep respect both for the man and his work with @ewasolions in the Samburu, northern Kenya. The African lion population has declined by 43% in the last 20 years and lions now occupy only 8% of their historical range in Africa. The estimated numbers of lions across Africa are approximately 20,000. In Kenya, the national population now numbers less than 2,000 individuals. At current rates of decline, the species could become extinct here within the next two decades. This reduction in lion numbers is primarily due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, typically when lions kill people’s livestock. Lions and other large carnivores are wide-ranging species, and designated protected areas are often not large enough to ensure their long-term survival. It is crucial, therefore, that conservation of these species, as well as their prey, is addressed throughout the landscape, which not only incorporates protected areas, but also the surrounding areas where local people live. @ewasolions is dedicated to conserving lions and other large carnivores by promoting co-existence between people and wildlife, they work hand-in-hand with local communities to provide education, training and improved conservation practices that help people and wildlife, using sound science to help guide the long-term conservation of lions across community conservancies and protected areas in northern Kenya, and I love their work 👍🏿👍🏼💚to see more of it, follow me here @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @natgeo @everydayextinction @ewasolions #conserving  #conservation  #carnevores  #northernkenya  #kenya ",593,250200,"['people', 'tribe', 'tradition', 'recreation', 'tourism', 'ritual']"

But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range.

Scientists put heart rate monitors on albatross to gauge their energy expenditure during different activities. The study found that if the wind direction was favorable for the direction the bird wanted to travel, their heart rate was not much higher than when they’re sat on the water resting. This shows that their 11ft wingspan combined with ultra efficient flying techniques allow flight with very little extra energy cost. Nice one nature.

Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy.

This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities.

At least that is the way it is largely perceived. While living with and reacting to those consequences, women are hardly passive victims, though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. // This work was supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a humanitarian organization working on all sides of conflict to alleviate people’s suffering.

I got to work in India for the first time in what was kind of the twilight of my career that dates back to 1964. I was assigned by @natgeo to photograph the Dalits, also known as the Untouchables, those people who exist on the lowest rung of the India caste system. This man has just emerged from cleaning out a sewer filled with filth by using only a bucket and a rope. After finishing and closing the concrete cover, he had to go to several nearby homes before gaining permission to wash himself off with a garden hose. Because he is an Untouchable he is destined to do what his father, his grandfather, and all the men in his family's past did, to clean waste from sewers. There are Untouchables generations destined to a tradition of washing clothes, or tanning leather hides, or other tasks members of the upper castes refuse to do. Despite his situation, this man who sits covered in sewage, wears a thin gold chain around his neck and I was struck by how it seemed to match the glint of pride in his eyes as I made his portrait.

The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 240km (150mi) east of the Horn of Africa. It has been described as """"the most alien-looking place on Earth”. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life isn't found anywhere else on Earth. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 endemic species; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more.

The cave of Altamira was reported in 1880 by Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. It was the first paleolithic art cave to be identified. The cave was first greeted with amazement but the discovery soon deteriorated into deep controversy that followed Marcelino Sanz de Salutoula to his grave. In the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. Paintings like this could not have possibly been made by Ice Age people. It was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in France that Altamira was accepted as genuine. Archaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the Upper Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 BCE). Uranium/Thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the Aurignacian and Solutrean periods (36,000-22,000 BCE).

I trust Kendall has weathered this hurricane. He and his family have weathered storms on the Gulf for more than a century. Hopefully he will be tonging for oysters and caring for the bay again soon. Maybe there will be a silver lining and the hurricane will have dissipated the red tide that has been plaguing the Gulf this summer, arguably exacerbated by pollution from millions of coastal residence who don't live in balance with the ecosystem the way Kendall does.

The reality is, I’m somewhat unable to speak when making photographs. It’s a genetic flaw or some right brain/left brain quirk realized when I was rejected from my childhood garage band for not being able to sing and play drums at the same time. Damn you Phil Collins. When we work, this leaves me with a limited menu of grunting noises and the occasional guttural outburst, which I still find helpful in getting an animals attention.

This gently portrait of an Amish boy holding his pet guinea pig started my career as a professional photographer and my 50 years as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine. In the spring of 1964, I was blessed with getting a photographic internship at National Geographic in Washington D.C. after showing my portfolio of work to Robert E. Gilka, the legendary director of photography at National Geographic. As my first assignment as an intern, Gilka sent me to Lancaster County, PA to cover a Pennsylvania Dutch festival. """"Try to get some pictures of the Amish, if you can,"""" he told me. It seemed the magazine had a finished manuscript about the Amish but had no pictures. He didn't tell he'd earlier sent a staff photographer to Pennsylvania who'd come back with nothing. Although I photographed the festival events my success with the Amish came through driving the country roads, introducing myself to Amish farmers, many of whom turned me down but eventually finding one who allowed me to photograph his family and their way of life. My first assignment which was to have been for a weekend or perhaps a week, lasted through much of the summer and into the fall of 1964. On an overcast afternoon, after photographing an Amish farmer working in his fields I was brought to the barn by his son so he could show me his pet guinea pig. My portrait of the boy and his pet became the lead picture in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster county published in the August, 1965 issue, a story which has been credited as the beginning of a new, more intimate look at people in the National Geographic Magazine. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of the Amish and other assignments spanning a five-decade career. @thephotosociety #amish  #farm  #onassignment  #filmphotography ",1938,377130,"['fashion accessory', 'headgear', 'hat', 'smile', 'facial hair', 'cowboy hat', 'fedora']"

The portrait of the fragile but seemingly unafraid little girl seen alongside the heads of two enormous draft horses was published in the August, 1964 issue of National Geographic in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The child was with her father who was working in his fields. At some point in the afternoon she was standing in the back of a farm wagon, the horses, unhitched, were about to be led to the barn and for a moment they provided the background for her profile. Her blouse appears worn, perhaps a bit dirty from childish play, and its pale blue color seems to echo the softness in the child's light complexion and wispy, blond hair. Photographing the Amish was the beginning of my photographic depiction of several subcultures in my country and elsewhere during the 1960's. My essays on the Amish in 1964, the Basques of France and Spain in 1968, and the Hutterites of Montana in 1969, all dealt with the lives of people living in a culture of their own. #followme  @williamalbertallard for more images of the Amish and other assignments spanning five-decades. @thephotosociety #amish  #farm  #child  #horses  #onassignment  #filmphotography ",1210,421955,"['horse', 'rein', 'horse like mammal', 'horse tack', 'snout', 'horse supplies', 'bridle', 'pack animal', 'horse harness', 'mane']"

It is still a global struggle to have girls valued for more than their bodies — for just their sexuality, fertility and labor. Today we come together to help galvanize support and inspire the international community to do its part to establish, expand and protect girls’ rights so girls are free to determine the course of their own lives.

I’m posting her photograph to remember her and other young Haitian girls today on the International #DayoftheGirl . She was a student in a small local school. She told me she loved to read and that one day she hoped to be a nurse. I never saw her again after that visit but I think of her quite often because she so embodied the spirit and talent and the hopes and sense of possibility that all Haitians share and that is shared by young girls around the world. I hope she accomplished her dreams. Like many developing nations, the literacy rate in Haiti is low and below the average for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Haiti faces shortages in educational supplies and qualified teachers where the rural population is less educated than the urban. A major earthquake in 2010 exacerbated an already difficult system by destroying infrastructure and displacing 50 to 90% of of students. Private education, which must be paid for, has substituted for education in public schools although the government has attempted initiatives to change this. I tried very hard to help educate children in Haiti but the need was like a bottomless pit. In the world young women 15-29 are more than 3 times as likely as young men to not be in employment, education or training, according to UNICEF. Education can help change stereotypes we have held onto too long and take advantage of the talent and creative voices of girls to make a more vibrant and equitable world. There are many organisations, ranging from public to private, that support and promote the education of girls around the world. If you want to make the world a better place and safer for young women, please consider researching and supporting the education of girls and give them a voice. #dayofthegirl  #tooyoungtowed  #unicef  #educategirls  #haiti  #education ",529,170767,"['face', 'eyebrow', 'nose', 'forehead', 'chin', 'head', 'hairstyle', 'cheek', 'temple', 'lip']"

Taking their commitment to bring sight to the world, OneSight, an independent nonprofit, hosted their first-ever, fully digital, eye clinic in the Amazon.

It can create a cascading series of problems for individuals, families, and communities - starting in school, when students can’t see what’s going on and have trouble reading. Uncorrected vision can have an impact on a persons employment prospects and even lead to social isolation. // Over a billion people across the world need glasses, but have no way to get them.
